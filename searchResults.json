        "text": "The demand for aircraft engineers and technicians has risen to previously unheard-of levels in an era of rapid technical innovation and a global boom in air travel. The demand for competent people to develop, maintain, and pioneer new aircraft designs grows along with the aviation sector.  Current Demand for Aircraft Engineers and Technicians  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts that by 2037, the number of passengers flying across the world will have doubled, totaling 8.2 billion passengers yearly. An increase in the aviation workforce, including engineers and technicians, is required because of this growth. According to Boeing’s 2021 Commercial Market Outlook, over the next 20 years, the world’s commercial aviation fleet will need 43,610 new aircraft. A greater need for experts who can design, maintain, and service modern aircraft results from this significant expansion. Moreover, the aviation sector is going through a technological revolution, with the rise of autonomous systems, advanced materials, and electric planes. Meanwhile, a sizable section of the aviation industry is getting close to retirement age, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Jainita Hogervorst, Director of Aerviva Aviation Consultancy, a Dubai-based international consultancy, says that “new talent can now fill opportunities in a variety of aviation-related sectors as a result. To spur innovation, aeronautical engineers, and technicians with knowledge in these fields are in high demand.” As of the latest data available, the demand for these professionals is strong and is expected to continue growing. In the United States of America, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that from 2020 to 2030, the requirement for aerospace engineers will increase by 5%, which is a little faster than the average for all occupations. The BLS also predicts a 3% increase in demand for mechanics and technicians of aircraft and avionics equipment during the same time period. This prediction is in line with Boeing’s 2020 Pilot and Technician Outlook, which projected the global aviation industry will require 769,000 new maintenance technicians from 2020 to 2039. The continual need for aircraft maintenance, repair, and retrofitting is the main cause of this growth. Furthermore, Airbus’ Global Services Forecast 2020-2039 estimated that the global MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) market would grow at an annual rate of 4.1%, creating ample job opportunities for aeronautic engineers and technicians. Engineers and technicians are crucial in other ways as well. The airline sector is making an active effort to reduce its carbon impact. For instance, Airbus has set high standards for producing zero-emission aircraft by 2035. These revolutionary advancements will be led by aircraft engineers. These professionals will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of aviation by designing eco-friendly aircraft, pioneering technological innovations, and ensuring the safety and efficiency of air travel. In the words of Hogervorst, “The aircraft engineers and technicians of tomorrow will have the opportunity to contribute to a more sustainable and connected world where their skills are in high demand, ensuring a prosperous and innovative future where their expertise will be at the heart of the aviation industry’s ongoing success.” Aerviva Aviation Consultancy specialises in aviation recruitment and document management, connects aspiring engineers and technicians to companies where their skills are in high demand.. In summary, the current and future demand for aeronautic engineers and technicians in the aviation industry is substantial and promising. As air travel continues to grow, alongside technological innovation, opportunities for skilled professionals in this field are poised to expand significantly.

        "text": "2023 marked another dynamic year for aerospace. New challenges appeared, others stuck around and some thankfully faded.  \nWhat changes could 2024 bring? We spoke with five GE Aerospace experts on the trends they are watching next year and the impact those trends will have on the global aerospace system.\n   \n 1) STEP UP IN SUSTAINABILITY: Milestones push industry to accelerate Sustainable Aviation Fuel, technology.  \n2030 sustainability milestones are rapidly approaching, and while countries around the world are pursuing multiple approaches to reduce aviation emissions, one of the most promising contenders is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF. The United States plans to produce 3 billion gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel by then compared to the 15.8 million gallons used in 2022. In Europe, the continent will require 6 percent of all aviation fuel be SAF, up from its 2 percent today. And more than 100 countries just agreed that aviation fuel in 2030 should be 5 percent less carbon intensive – so expect to hear a lot about SAF in 2024.\nWhile GE Aerospace and partner engines can run on SAF blends today, the U.S. will need to extend an expiring tax credit that incentivizes SAF production to help maintain price parity with standard Jet-A fuel. Meanwhile, the FAA is expected to award next year more than $245 million for projects that transport, store, or produce SAF.\n“There is no one-fuel or one-technology that will get us to the net-zero goal. It will take new fuels, it will take new engines, and it will take new technologies to get us there,” said Mohamed Ali, GE Aerospace’s vice president and general manager for the company’s engineering division. “We don’t have a day to spare.”\nWhile SAF will lead the way next year, count on manufacturers to keep investing heavily in engine efficiency technologies necessary for the 15-20 percent carbon emissions reductions most net-zero plans count on. The open-fan engine architecture GE Aerospace and Safran are jointly developing as part of the CFM RISE program is targeting a more than 20-percent fuel efficiency boost compared to engines today*. GE Aerospace is also partnering with NASA and Boeing to develop a hybrid-electric powertrain for flight and CFM is developing hydrogen combustion technologies in collaboration with Airbus. Expect all of these to gain more attention in 2024.\n *CFM International is a 50/50 joint company between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines  \n   \n 2) WORKERS WANTED: Increased attention to train workers building, repairing, and maintaining aircraft and engines.  \nAirlines have hired thousands of pilots since the pandemic, improving their operations and helping meet post-pandemic travel demand. But the need for workers who build, maintain and repair those aircraft and their engines shows no sign of easing.\nOne report from AAR Corp. forecasts that the global aviation market will need 34,500 new mechanics annually, that is in addition to thousands of aerospace engineers needed each year during the next decade, and even more workers who need trade skills to do many good-paying jobs in aerospace.\n“A job in aerospace can become a great career. There are plenty of workers, but we must expand our outreach to recruit and provide people with those skills,” said Russell Stokes, president and CEO of GE Aerospace Commercial Engines and Services.  \nLook for aerospace manufacturers to expand their apprenticeship programs, build partnerships, and try new models to recruit and retain workers. In Massachusetts, a partnership between GE Aerospace and the state has helped more than 300* individual so far each receive 415 hours of no-cost technical training from experienced aerospace instructors. And late this year, GE Aerospace opened a new training academy for its apprenticeship program in Wales in the United Kingdom.\n *Latest numbers from end of CY2022.  \n   \n 3) FUTURE FIGHTERS: Geopolitical tensions will continue, highlighting need for new capabilities.  \nThe wars in Ukraine and Israel serve as reminders of the geopolitical tensions that exist and the importance of investing today to ensure we can meet the needs of the U.S. military both today and in the future. For aviation, this means providing the warfighter with more range, greater thrust, and better thermal management to allow more mission systems capabilities.\n“Every generation has to earn their place in the sky; it is not promised to us,” said Amy Gowder, president and CEO of GE Aerospace Defense &amp; Systems.  \nExpect the conversation in Washington and other capitals to focus on the need for not just increase defense spending but investment in industrial bases to bring new capabilities online, including advanced engine development. Both the House and Senate have set aside $150 million and $280 million, respectively, in the FY2024 appropriations bills to continue work on one of those advanced engines, GE Aerospace’s XA100 adaptive engine, which recently completed a third round of testing \n“An adaptive engine is the first, 21st century engine that will allow the United States to maintain its air dominance,” Gowder said.  \n   \n 4) MADE IN: U.S. will continue push for more manufacturing.  \nRegardless of the outcome of the 2024 elections, increasing manufacturing in the United States will remain a priority for the country, compelling companies to both invest and make sure leaders know about it. This pressure, combined with decades-worth of orders from airlines, will keep aerospace workers busy building engines and airframes.\nWe will see companies invest to meet those demands and stay competitive. Already, GE Aerospace invested $335 million in its U.S. manufacturing operations in 2023 alone. Upgraded test cells in Lynn, Mass., facility improvements in Auburn, Ala., where additive manufacturing occurs, and new tooling in Lafayette, Ind., in anticipation of increased LEAP engine production were just some of the investments.\n“These are investments not only in the future of flight, but in strong futures for the communities where we operate, ensuring our ability to continue making innovative, high-quality engines in the US and around the world,” said Tara DiJulio, GE Aerospace’s chief corporate affairs officer.  \n   \n 5) TRAVEL DEMAND: Companies will look for new strategies to meet strong travel demand.  \n2023 marked the return to pre-pandemic air travel levels as airlines across the globe placed a record number of plane and engine orders. They’ll need that capacity to meet air travel demand that shows no sign of slowing down: The United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East all reached pre-pandemic traffic levels in 2023. Asia-Pacific and Africa will in 2024. Manufacturers will look for ways to maintain quality as production increases.\n“More and more people are flying to see family, do business and make connections around the world, and we are using every tool we have — especially Lean — to help airlines maximize the availability of their fleet and to deliver the engines they need to meet demand,” said Mike Kauffman, GE Aerospace’s vice president of supply chain.  \nTake GE Aerospace’s site in Greenville, South Carolina. The team used Lean to make the CFM engine lines 25 percent more efficient while reducing the resource used by 34 percent.\nOr head to one of the company’s On Wing Support facilities near the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. The team looked at how to reduce the time it took to teardown an engine, order parts and reassemble the engine. Through Lean, they were able to reduce the time by more than 33 percent, getting planes back in the sky sooner for airlines.\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Lehner\n[email protected] \n202-841-8485\n ||||I|||| * Archive\n* GEAerospace.com\n* Subscribe\n*\nSelect Page\nInteractive Timeline\nFive Trends that will Shape Aerospace in 2024\nDec 18, 2023 | Manufacturing, military, People, Product, Sustainability, Technology by GE Aerospace News Staff\n2023 marked another dynamic year for aerospace.

        "text": "The forecast shows that between 2023-2042, 45,200 new passenger aircraft will be delivered at an estimated value of $3.2 trillion.\nFreight capacity is forecast to grow 4.1% annually compared with 2022.\nAirbus and Boeing remain the two dominant commercial aircraft OEMs, between them delivering an estimated 89% of aircraft through to 2042.\n LONDON, JANUARY 11, 2024 – Cirium, the world’s most trusted source of aviation analytics, has today published its 2023 Fleet Forecast, through the Cirium Ascend Consultancy, revealing that annual passenger aircraft deliveries are set to exceed $100 billion in 2024.\nThe forecast, which enters its eleventh year of publication, also predicts that freight capacity will grow 4.1% annually compared with 2022, and that 3,590 freighter aircraft will be supplied over the next 20 years, including 1,060 new build aircraft and 2,530 conversions from passenger aircraft.\nAirbus and Boeing will continue to dominate the commercial aircraft manufacturing space, with a combined delivery projection of 89% of all aircraft through to 2042.\n Figure 1\tForecast deliveries 2023-2042 \n Rob Morris, Head of Consultancy, at Cirium Ascend Consultancy, said: “With global traffic almost back to 2019 levels, the increased levels of order activity in 2023 shows that the airline industry’s new growth cycle is gaining momentum. \n  \nThe 2023 Cirium Fleet Forecast predicts new deliveries will total $3.2 trillion over the next 20 years.\nThe CFF capacity modelling gives an independent view of future demand for aircraft and questions such as: are higher single-aisle production volumes justified? What will be shares between A321neo and 737-10, A350-1000 and 777-9, A350F and 777-8F? Airbus and Boeing are forecast to take almost 90% of the market but when could they introduce new programmes and what market share will new Chinese programmes take?”\nFrom a regional perspective, Asia will continue to lead the way, with China forecast to have the highest passenger capacity growth rate at over 8%. \nThis will make it the largest single country in the region for deliveries, with a 19% share of global deliveries, ahead of all other Asia-Pacific countries with a combined share of 24%.\nNorth American airlines follow with 20% and Europe with 18%. Middle East airlines will take 7% of deliveries, but the share rises to 11% in value terms due to the rich mix of higher value twin-aisle deliveries.\n Figure 2\tForecast new deliveries 2023-2042 by airline region \nThe Cirium Fleet Forecast adopts a scenario-based approach that favours examining the most up to date information available, combined with expert commentary and analysis. This year’s forecast is based on the recently adjusted version of Ascend’s 2022 Recovery Scenario 7, which is detailed in the full Fleet Forecast report.\n Download the executive summary of the report or contact us to purchase the full report.\n For media enquiries please contact:  media@cirium.com   \n About Cirium \n Cirium is the world’s most trusted source of aviation analytics.

2024\nJanuary 11, 2024\nThe forecast shows that between 2023-2042, 45,200 new passenger aircraft will be delivered at an estimated value of $3.2 trillion.\n* The forecast shows that between 2023-2042, 45,200 new passenger aircraft will be delivered at an estimated value of $3.2 trillion.\n* Freight capacity is forecast to grow 4.1% annually compared with 2022.\n* Airbus and Boeing remain the two dominant commercial aircraft OEMs, between them delivering an estimated 89% of aircraft through to 2042.\nLONDON, JANUARY 11, 2024 – Cirium, the world’s most trusted source of aviation analytics, has today published its 2023 Fleet Forecast, through the Cirium Ascend Consultancy, revealing that annual passenger aircraft deliveries are set to exceed $100 billion in 2024.\nThe forecast, which enters its eleventh year of publication, also predicts that freight capacity will grow 4.1% annually compared with 2022, and that 3,590 freighter aircraft will be supplied over the next 20 years, including 1,060 new build aircraft and 2,530 conversions from passenger aircraft.\nAirbus and Boeing will continue to dominate the commercial aircraft manufacturing space, with a combined delivery projection of 89% of all aircraft through to 2042.\nFigure 1 Forecast deliveries 2023-2042\nRob Morris, Head of Consultancy, at Cirium Ascend Consultancy, said: “With global traffic almost back to 2019 levels, the increased levels of order activity in 2023 shows that the airline industry’s new growth cycle is gaining momentum.\nThe 2023 Cirium Fleet Forecast predicts new deliveries will total $3.2 trillion over the next 20 years.\nThe CFF capacity modelling gives an independent view of future demand for aircraft and questions such as: are higher single-aisle production volumes justified? What will be shares between A321neo and 737-10, A350-1000 and 777-9, A350F and 777-8F? Airbus and Boeing are forecast to take almost 90% of the market but when could they introduce new programmes and what market share will new Chinese programmes take?”\nFrom a regional perspective, Asia will continue to lead the way, with China forecast to have the highest passenger capacity growth rate at over 8%.\nThis will make it the largest single country in the region for deliveries, with a 19% share of global deliveries, ahead of all other Asia-Pacific countries with a combined share of 24%.\nNorth American airlines follow with 20% and Europe with 18%. Middle East airlines will take 7% of deliveries, but the share rises to 11% in value terms due to the rich mix of higher value twin-aisle deliveries.\nFigure 2 Forecast new deliveries 2023-2042 by airline region\nThe Cirium Fleet Forecast adopts a scenario-based approach that favours examining the most up to date information available, combined with expert commentary and analysis. This year’s forecast is based on the recently adjusted version of Ascend’s 2022 Recovery Scenario 7, which is detailed in the full Fleet Forecast report.\nDownload the executive summary of the report or contact us to purchase the full report.\nFor media enquiries please contact: media@cirium.com\nAbout Cirium\nCirium is the world’s most trusted source of aviation analytics.

        "text": "WICHITA, Kan., July 1, 2024 – Spirit AeroSystems [NYSE: SPR] (“Spirit”) today announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] (“Boeing”) will acquire Spirit for $37.25 per share in Boeing common stock (subject to the collar described below). At $37.25 per share, this represents an equity value of approximately $4.7 billion and an enterprise value of approximately $8.3 billion including Spirit’s last reported net debt. The price of $37.25 per share represents a 30% premium to Spirit’s closing stock price of $28.60 on February 29, 2024, the last day before both Spirit and Boeing issued press releases confirming they were in discussions regarding a potential transaction. \n“After carefully evaluating Boeing’s offer to combine, we are confident this transaction is in the best interest of Spirit and its shareholders, and will benefit Spirit’s other stakeholders,” said Patrick M. Shanahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spirit. “Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies’ manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems.”\nSpirit also announced today that it entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE [EUR: AIR.PA] (“Airbus”). Under the term sheet, the parties will continue to negotiate in good faith to enter into definitive agreements for Airbus to acquire certain Spirit assets that serve Airbus programs, concurrently with the closing of Spirit’s acquisition by Boeing. \nShanahan continued, “We are proud of the part we have played in Airbus’ programs and believe bringing these programs under Airbus ownership will enable greater integration and alignment.”\n Transaction Terms \nUnder the terms of the definitive merger agreement with Boeing, Spirit shareholders will receive for each of their shares of Spirit common stock a number of shares of Boeing common stock equal to an exchange ratio calculated as $37.25 divided by the volume weighted average share price (VWAP) of Boeing common stock over the 15-trading-day period ending on the second trading day prior to the closing (the “Closing Price”), subject to a floor of $149.00 per share of Boeing common stock and a ceiling of $206.94 per share of Boeing common stock. Spirit shareholders will receive 0.25 shares of Boeing common stock for each of their shares of Spirit common stock if the Closing Price is at or below $149.00, and 0.18 shares of Boeing common stock for each of their shares of Spirit common stock if the Closing Price is at or above $206.94. \nThe definitive merger agreement with Boeing and the term sheet with Airbus were unanimously approved by the Spirit Board of Directors. The closing under the definitive merger agreement with Boeing is subject to the completion of the divestiture of the Airbus businesses by Spirit and is subject to other closing conditions, including approval of the definitive merger agreement by Spirit shareholders and receipt of regulatory approvals. The closing of the Airbus transaction, if a definitive agreement for the Airbus transaction is entered into with Airbus, will be subject to the substantially concurrent closing of the Boeing acquisition of Spirit and will be subject to other closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. The closings of these transactions are expected to occur in mid-2025.\nIn addition, Spirit plans to pursue the divestiture of certain operations. These include Spirit’s business and operations in (1) Subang, Malaysia, (2) Prestwick, Scotland that support Airbus programs, and (3) Belfast, Northern Ireland other than those that support Airbus programs.\n Advisors \nMorgan Stanley &amp; Co.

At $37.25 per share, this represents an equity value of approximately $4.7 billion and an enterprise value of approximately $8.3 billion including Spirit’s last reported net debt. The price of $37.25 per share represents a 30% premium to Spirit’s closing stock price of $28.60 on February 29, 2024, the last day before both Spirit and Boeing issued press releases confirming they were in discussions regarding a potential transaction.\n“After carefully evaluating Boeing’s offer to combine, we are confident this transaction is in the best interest of Spirit and its shareholders, and will benefit Spirit’s other stakeholders,” said Patrick M. Shanahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spirit. “Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies’ manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems.”\nSpirit also announced today that it entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE [EUR: AIR.PA] (“Airbus”). Under the term sheet, the parties will continue to negotiate in good faith to enter into definitive agreements for Airbus to acquire certain Spirit assets that serve Airbus programs, concurrently with the closing of Spirit’s acquisition by Boeing.\nShanahan continued, “We are proud of the part we have played in Airbus’ programs and believe bringing these programs under Airbus ownership will enable greater integration and alignment.”\nTransaction Terms\nUnder the terms of the definitive merger agreement with Boeing, Spirit shareholders will receive for each of their shares of Spirit common stock a number of shares of Boeing common stock equal to an exchange ratio calculated as $37.25 divided by the volume weighted average share price (VWAP) of Boeing common stock over the 15-trading-day period ending on the second trading day prior to the closing (the “Closing Price”), subject to a floor of $149.00 per share of Boeing common stock and a ceiling of $206.94 per share of Boeing common stock. Spirit shareholders will receive 0.25 shares of Boeing common stock for each of their shares of Spirit common stock if the Closing Price is at or below $149.00, and 0.18 shares of Boeing common stock for each of their shares of Spirit common stock if the Closing Price is at or above $206.94.\nThe definitive merger agreement with Boeing and the term sheet with Airbus were unanimously approved by the Spirit Board of Directors. The closing under the definitive merger agreement with Boeing is subject to the completion of the divestiture of the Airbus businesses by Spirit and is subject to other closing conditions, including approval of the definitive merger agreement by Spirit shareholders and receipt of regulatory approvals. The closing of the Airbus transaction, if a definitive agreement for the Airbus transaction is entered into with Airbus, will be subject to the substantially concurrent closing of the Boeing acquisition of Spirit and will be subject to other closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. The closings of these transactions are expected to occur in mid-2025.\nIn addition, Spirit plans to pursue the divestiture of certain operations. These include Spirit’s business and operations in (1) Subang, Malaysia, (2) Prestwick, Scotland that support Airbus programs, and (3) Belfast, Northern Ireland other than those that support Airbus programs.\nAdvisors\nMorgan Stanley & Co.

Other income primarily reflects an increase in investment income due to higher interest rates. The second quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the tax benefit on pre-tax losses including cumulative adjustments related to a projected increase in the valuation allowance.\n  Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures  \nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:\n Core Operating Earnings/(loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(loss) Per Share  \nCore operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures is provided on page 12 and page 13.\n Free Cash Flow \nFree cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 and page 14 for reconciliations of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.\n Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements \nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"targets,\" \"anticipates,\" and similar expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements.

Debt was $52 .3 billion, down from $55 .4 billion at the beginning of the quarter due to the pay down of maturing debt. The company maintains access to credit facilities of $12.0 billion , which remain undrawn.\nTotal company backlog at quarter end was $440 billion .\nSegment Results\nCommercial Airplanes\nTable 4.

Operating margin of (4.3) percent also reflects abnormal costs and period expenses, including research and development.\nThe 737 program is transitioning production to 38 per month and plans to reach 50 per month in the 2025/2026 timeframe. The program still expects to deliver 400-450 airplanes this year.\nThe 787 program increased production to four per month with plans to ramp to five per month in late 2023 and 10 per month in the 2025/2026 timeframe. The program still expects to deliver 70-80 airplanes this year.\nDuring the quarter, Commercial Airplanes booked 460 net orders, including 220 for Air India and 39 for Riyadh Air, and secured a commitment from Ryanair for up to 300 737 MAX airplanes. Commercial Airplanes delivered 136 airplanes during the quarter and backlog included over 4,800 airplanes valued at $363 billion .\nDefense, Space & Security\nTable 5.

Second quarter operating margin was (8.5) percent, primarily driven by losses on certain fixed-price development programs, as well as continued operational impacts of labor instability and supply chain disruption on other programs. The Commercial Crew program recorded a $257 million loss primarily due to the impacts of the previously announced launch delay. The T-7A program recorded a $189 million loss primarily due to higher estimated costs on production contracts. The MQ-25 program also recorded a $68 million loss primarily due to schedule delays on the Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract.\nDuring the quarter, Defense, Space & Security completed the U.S. Air Force first flight of the T-7A Red Hawk , began construction on the Advanced Coatings Center in St. Louis and captured an award from the U.S. Army for 19 CH-47 Chinooks. Backlog at Defense, Space & Security was $58 billion , of which 31 percent represents orders from customers outside the U.S.\nGlobal Services\nTable 6. Global Services Second Quarter First Half\n(Dollars in Millions) 2023 2022 Change 2023 2022 Change\nRevenues $4,746 $4,298 10 % $9,466 $8,612 10 %\nEarnings from operations $856 $728 18 % $1,703 $1,360 25 %\nOperating margins 18.0 % 16.9 % 1.1 pts 18.0 % 15.8 % 2.2 pts\nGlobal Services second quarter revenue of $4.7 billion and operating margin of 18.0 percent reflect higher commercial volume and favorable mix.\nDuring the quarter, Global Services announced expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, collaboration with CAE to enhance and expand training solutions and Japan Airlines adopted Boeing Insight Accelerator for its 787 fleet.\nAdditional Financial Information\nTable 7.

Other income primarily reflects an increase in investment income due to higher interest rates. The second quarter effective tax rate primarily reflects the tax benefit on pre-tax losses including cumulative adjustments related to a projected increase in the valuation allowance.\nNon-GAAP Measures Disclosures\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:\nCore Operating Earnings/(loss), Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings/(loss) Per Share\nCore operating earnings/(loss) is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings/(loss) expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings/(loss) per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP measures is provided on page 12 and page 13.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. See Table 2 on page 2 and page 14 for reconciliations of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"targets,\" \"anticipates,\" and similar expressions generally identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future financial condition and operating results, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to: (1) general conditions in the economy and our industry, including those due to regulatory changes; (2) our reliance on our commercial airline customers; (3) the overall health of our aircraft production system, planned commercial aircraft production rate changes, our ability to successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and the ability of our aircraft to meet stringent performance and reliability standards; (4) changing budget and appropriation levels and acquisition priorities of the U.S. government, as well as the potential impact of a government shutdown; (5) our dependence on our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as the availability of highly skilled labor and raw materials; (6) competition within our markets; (7) our non-U.S. operations and sales to non-U.S. customers; (8) changes in accounting estimates; (9) realizing the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures; (10) our dependence on U.S. government contracts; (11) our reliance on fixed-price contracts; (12) our reliance on cost-type contracts; (13) contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments; (14) unauthorized access to our, our customers' and/or our suppliers' information and systems; (15) potential business disruptions, including threats to physical security or our information technology systems, extreme weather (including effects of climate change) or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises; (16) potential adverse developments in new or pending litigation and/or government inquiries or investigations; (17) potential environmental liabilities; (18) effects of climate change and legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; (19) changes in our ability to obtain debt financing on commercially reasonable terms, at competitive rates and in sufficient amounts; (20) substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; (21) the adequacy of our insurance coverage; (22) customer and aircraft concentration in our customer financing portfolio; and (23) work stoppages or other labor disruptions.\nAdditional information concerning these and other factors can be found in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations: Matt Welch or David Dufault (312) 544-2140\nCommunications: Michael Friedman media@boeing.com\nThe Boeing Company

        "text": "M&amp;A activity in 2023 was subdued, as dealmakers grappled with geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates, and increasing regulatory scrutiny, against a backdrop of general economic uncertainty. Challenges in the U.S. banking sector in the early part of the year also took their toll. But deals got done. While the total value of deals fell by about 23%,  to the lowest level since 2013, the number of deals fell by 16%, reflecting a focus on smaller deals. Some sectors stood out: tech, while down from prior years, continued its strong run, as artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies created market buzz, and oil and gas in Q4 edged out tech, by value, for the first time in recent memory, thanks in part to two blockbuster transactions. In Q4 the M&amp;A market showed some signs of recovery. Big-ticket ($2BN+) deals hit their highest levels since Q2 2022, and five of the year’s 10 largest global deals were announced. Further clarity on, if not resolution of, some of 2023’s challenges may lift M&amp;A in 2024 as companies seek to implement growth, earnings, and valuation strategies. In this alert, we review the M&amp;A markets in 2023 and the major legal and regulatory trends affecting deals in 2024.     Global Activity Global activity through December 15 reached $2.9 trillion in value, down 23% year-over-year.   North America – North America deals totaled $1.46 trillion, down 12% from 2022. The second half of the year saw promising activity, with several megadeals announced in September and October, including Cisco’s agreement to acquire Splunk, Exxon’s agreement to acquire Pioneer, and Chevron’s agreement to acquire Hess. U.S. capital markets were buoyed in September by Arm’s $5 billion debut on Nasdaq (in which MoFo represented Arm), the largest IPO since 2021.  Asia-Pacific – Asia-Pacific deals totaled $708.2 billion, a 26% year-over-year decline. Among other things, cross-border activity between China and the U.S. continued to stall. Japan was a bright spot, with the number of deals up 34% compared to 2022. Healthcare M&amp;A in APAC saw its highest value level ever, and auto industry M&amp;A was up 80% year-over-year.  Europe – EMEA saw $676 billion in deal activity, a 35% drop compared to 2022. U.S. companies led the most in-bound acquisitions, with deals valued at $89 billion. Much like the global M&amp;A market, the number of EMEA deals saw a notable increase in Q4, up 13% compared with Q3.   Tech – Tech remained a top choice for dealmakers, accounting for 27% of deal value. In our 2023 Tech M&amp;A Survey, dealmakers picked cybersecurity as the most promising subsector for deals over the next 12 months, with the AI sector also presenting strong dealmaking opportunities.  Healthcare – Healthcare continued to perform. In North America, healthcare was the third-highest sector by volume, led by several large M&amp;A transactions, including Pfizer’s $43 billion takeover of Seagen. As noted above, healthcare M&amp;A in APAC saw its highest value level ever, led in part by Daiichi Sankyo’s $22 billion deal with Merck.  Private Equity – Sponsors took a cautious approach to M&amp;A, with global private equity deals dropping 33% in volume and 41% in value year-over-year. In the"

        "text": "At a Glance\nIn 2023, the total M&amp;A market dropped 15%, to $3.2 trillion, the lowest level in a decade.\nStrategic M&amp;A declined 6% as buyers and sellers struggled to close the gap on valuations, and strategic deal multiples were the lowest they've been in a decade.\nDeals were delayed for other reasons, including high interest rates, mixed macroeconomic signals, regulatory scrutiny, and geopolitical risks.\nMany longtime frequent acquirers used 2023 as an opportunity to expand their competitive advantage through M&amp;A.\nThis article is part of Bain's 2024 M&amp;A Report.\nIt’s no secret that the M&amp;A market declined in 2023 as the valuation gap between what buyers wanted to spend and what sellers wanted to charge for their companies kept many would-be deals from happening. M&amp;A practitioners told us that the valuation gap was the biggest obstacle to dealmaking, and there were other headwinds in 2023 as well, including high interest rates, macroeconomic uncertainty, rising regulatory scrutiny, and new political pressures.\nBut while down overall by 6% in value, the strategic M&amp;A market reflected uneven performance. For example, tech deals cratered while activity in healthcare and life sciences as well as energy and natural resources rebounded. The Americas market held steady as Europe and Asia faltered. Scratch beneath the placid surface, and you see how, across industries and around the world, winning companies turned to deals to reinvent their future, whether it was automakers acquiring to secure supplies for the transition to electric vehicles, insurers buying to expand their traditional role of risk protection to risk prevention, or media companies learning that partnering with former fierce competitors is the only way to win as their industry enters a new era.\nThe companies that made such moves will be those that emerge as leaders. Perhaps the most important M&amp;A news from 2023, however, was the widening of the performance gap between frequent acquirers and their inactive peers. According to our long-term research, frequent acquirers always outperform in total shareholder return. In 2023, that margin continued to grow.\nWhat the numbers say\nThe world of strategic M&amp;A still saw more than 27,000 deals announced, totaling about $2.4 trillion, a 6% decline in value from the year before (see Figure 1). If those numbers seem better than what you may have read in the newspapers, keep in mind that the broader world of leveraged private equity and venture capital deals had a much worse time (down 37% in value). Those businesses were more exposed to the rise of interest rates and issues of debt availability. In contrast, corporate buyers generally had stronger balance sheets with cash on hand to do deals.\nStill, no dealmaker could avoid the impact of rising interest rates. Nearly every executive we spoke with and a full 95% of those we surveyed agreed that higher interest rates required them to adapt their approach to M&amp;A in 2023. The No. 1 adjustment? Being more selective in which deals are being pursued, which was cited by two-thirds of respondents.\nBut the biggest obstacle was the gap between valuations, which contributed to the lowest year for strategic M&amp;A in a decade and caused prices to plunge. The valuation gap was the only thing that surveyed buyers and sellers seemed to agree on. More than two-thirds of buyers told us that it negatively impacted M&amp;A activity. On the other side of the table, at nearly the same rate, potential sellers cited more favorable deal valuations as a top factor in deciding when to bring their assets to market. In some ways, 2023 will be remembered as the year in which buyers and sellers waited for each other to blink.\nAnecdotally, we heard from our investment banking friends that a notable number of deal processes were abandoned before bids were accepted this past year. Why was it particularly hard to close the valuation gap in 2023? Our research pointed out four causes.\nAgain, rising interest rates played a major role. The big argument throughout 2023 was the shape of the interest rate curve in years to come. Buyers needed deals to deliver a margin of safety from higher-for-longer interest rates whereas sellers held back in hopes that rates would come back down.\nA second straight year of declining strategic deal valuations made dealmakers wary (see Figure 2). At 10.1 times, overall deal multiples were the lowest in 15 years, with room to fall further; most downturns find a trough between 9 times and 10 times. Amid declining valuations, buyers took a skeptical view of assets priced with pride while sellers saw little reason to give away value.\nMoreover, a healthy stock market in 2023 exacerbated the yawning gap between private and public market valuations. With stocks trading well, sellers and their shareholders preferred to hold on to assets rather than face dilution from selling at a depressed multiple.\nFinally, private equity exits were down 44% in value and 22% in volume. Besides cutting off a source of potentially attractive targets, deferred private equity exits meant that there were fewer marks for fair market value, further clouding price transparency.\nAnother factor behind fewer deals is increased scrutiny by regulators around the globe. The European Commission, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, and the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have eyed major mergers with skepticism, particularly tech and healthcare tie-ups. A total of $361 billion in deals have been challenged since 2022; most have closed, often with remedies. The dust has not yet settled on the evolving antitrust regulatory landscape as courts weigh in and new guidelines are proposed. National security concerns also remain a factor for sensitive sectors such as semiconductors or nuclear energy. In this environment, some deals may never get off the ground; others are more likely to be abandoned in the face of a challenge. We explore the impact of longer and more uncertain timelines in “Regulation and M&amp;A: How Scrutiny Raises the Bar for Acquirers.”\nLooking beneath the surface\nAcross industries, the collapse of tech M&amp;A was the biggest drag on strategic M&amp;A in 2023 (see Figure 3). Tech deal values declined by roughly 45% as median valuations, defined by enterprise value–to-EBITDA multiples, tumbled from 2021’s high of 25 times to 13 times last year. Emerson’s acquisition of National Instruments to expand automation capabilities and Cisco’s bid for Splunk for its cybersecurity capabilities point to the ongoing demand for high-quality (and profitable) tech assets. Yet, as we’ve explored elsewhere, a higher-for-longer interest rate environment changes the deal math for most tech deals predicated on growth over profitability (see  Global M&amp;A Report Midyear 2022  or  M&amp;A Midyear Report 2023: It Takes Two to Make a Market ).\nAt the same time, a healthy dose of big-ticket deals supported a strong M&amp;A year for energy and healthcare, prompted by differing sector dynamics. On the back of rising commodity prices, scale deals in energy and natural resources led the pack, with two megadeals in oil and gas and three additional major tie-ups comprising a total of about $175 billion in deal value, according to Dealogic. Companies in healthcare and life sciences continued their pursuit of growth via scope deals as represented by AbbVie’s back-to-back deals for ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics in December and Merck’s earlier acquisition of Prometheus.\nThe year saw a common thread of vertical dealmaking. Companies navigating a shock to the profit pool, whether a shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles or the rise of the Internet as a distribution channel, have turned to M&amp;A to transform. Automotive companies are doing deals, such as Stellantis’s investment in Lyten and Ford’s acquisition of Auto Motive Power, to secure access to critical charging technology and to invest in their own recharging grids. In media, the value chain has been redesigned through merging of content and distribution, leading to new strategies for partnerships and alliances.\nVertical M&amp;A can also reflect adaptive strategies in the face of industry consolidation. In the US, healthcare payers are using M&amp;A to build health delivery networks, as exemplified by CVS’s purchase of Oak Street Health this year.\nSpin-offs remained an essential tool in portfolio transformation as well. For example, Danaher continued its reorientation toward life sciences via a $23 billion spin-off of its water business (Veralto) while acquiring Abcam and its protein consumables business for $5.7 billion. Sanofi joined other healthcare companies in announcing the separation of its consumer health business. Spin-offs are exceedingly hard to get right, but top-quartile performers show how valuable they can be (see “When a Spin-Off Wins Big”).\nNotably, cross-border dealmaking was sustained as investors sought to enhance portfolios in more favorable markets. US buyers pursued more cross-border deals, up 34% in value, while domestic value rose 2%. Similarly, Brazil remained attractive to foreign investment, even as domestic dealmaking declined (see “M&amp;A in Brazil: International Buyers Act While Domestic Acquirers Show Caution”). Asia saw a 60% increase in deals from the Middle East as sovereign wealth funds sought to build supply chains and facilitate energy transitions.\nAnd megadeals made a mark in the second half of 2023, a possible signal that dealmakers were ready to look forward. For M&amp;A observers, the timing wasn’t too surprising. Many companies had sustained high levels of proactive deal screening and outside-in due diligence even as deal counts fell.

Who Wins in a Down Year?\nLooking Back at M&A in 2023: Who Wins in a Down Year?\nDeals slowed as buyers and sellers waited for the other to make the first move.\nBy David Harding, Dale Stafford, Kai Grass, Suzanne Kumar, and Lindsey White\n* January 30, 2024\n* min read\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReport\nLooking Back at M&A in 2023: Who Wins in a Down Year?\n*\n*\n*\n*\nProgress:\nListen to this article\nBeyondWords\nAt a Glance\n* In 2023, the total M&A market dropped 15%, to $3.2 trillion, the lowest level in a decade.\n* Strategic M&A declined 6% as buyers and sellers struggled to close the gap on valuations, and strategic deal multiples were the lowest they've been in a decade.\n* Deals were delayed for other reasons, including high interest rates, mixed macroeconomic signals, regulatory scrutiny, and geopolitical risks.\n* Many longtime frequent acquirers used 2023 as an opportunity to expand their competitive advantage through M&A.\nThis article is part of Bain's 2024 M&A Report.\nExplore the report\nIt’s no secret that the M&A market declined in 2023 as the valuation gap between what buyers wanted to spend and what sellers wanted to charge for their companies kept many would-be deals from happening. M&A practitioners told us that the valuation gap was the biggest obstacle to dealmaking, and there were other headwinds in 2023 as well, including high interest rates, macroeconomic uncertainty, rising regulatory scrutiny, and new political pressures.\nBut while down overall by 6% in value, the strategic M&A market reflected uneven performance. For example, tech deals cratered while activity in healthcare and life sciences as well as energy and natural resources rebounded. The Americas market held steady as Europe and Asia faltered. Scratch beneath the placid surface, and you see how, across industries and around the world, winning companies turned to deals to reinvent their future, whether it was automakers acquiring to secure supplies for the transition to electric vehicles, insurers buying to expand their traditional role of risk protection to risk prevention, or media companies learning that partnering with former fierce competitors is the only way to win as their industry enters a new era.\nThe companies that made such moves will be those that emerge as leaders. Perhaps the most important M&A news from 2023, however, was the widening of the performance gap between frequent acquirers and their inactive peers. According to our long-term research, frequent acquirers always outperform in total shareholder return. In 2023, that margin continued to grow.\nRegister: M&A Report live briefing on Feb. 29\nWhat the numbers say\nThe world of strategic M&A still saw more than 27,000 deals announced, totaling about $2.4 trillion, a 6% decline in value from the year before (see Figure 1). If those numbers seem better than what you may have read in the newspapers, keep in mind that the broader world of leveraged private equity and venture capital deals had a much worse time (down 37% in value). Those businesses were more exposed to the rise of interest rates and issues of debt availability. In contrast, corporate buyers generally had stronger balance sheets with cash on hand to do deals.\nFigure 1\n*\n*\n*\nGlobal M&A deal value was $3.2 trillion in 2023, down 15% year over year\nStill, no dealmaker could avoid the impact of rising interest rates. Nearly every executive we spoke with and a full 95% of those we surveyed agreed that higher interest rates required them to adapt their approach to M&A in 2023. The No. 1 adjustment? Being more selective in which deals are being pursued, which was cited by two-thirds of respondents.\nBut the biggest obstacle was the gap between valuations, which contributed to the lowest year for strategic M&A in a decade and caused prices to plunge. The valuation gap was the only thing that surveyed buyers and sellers seemed to agree on. More than two-thirds of buyers told us that it negatively impacted M&A activity. On the other side of the table, at nearly the same rate, potential sellers cited more favorable deal valuations as a top factor in deciding when to bring their assets to market. In some ways, 2023 will be remembered as the year in which buyers and sellers waited for each other to blink.\nAnecdotally, we heard from our investment banking friends that a notable number of deal processes were abandoned before bids were accepted this past year. Why was it particularly hard to close the valuation gap in 2023? Our research pointed out four causes.\n* Again, rising interest rates played a major role. The big argument throughout 2023 was the shape of the interest rate curve in years to come. Buyers needed deals to deliver a margin of safety from higher-for-longer interest rates whereas sellers held back in hopes that rates would come back down.\n* A second straight year of declining strategic deal valuations made dealmakers wary (see Figure 2). At 10.1 times, overall deal multiples were the lowest in 15 years, with room to fall further; most downturns find a trough between 9 times and 10 times. Amid declining valuations, buyers took a skeptical view of assets priced with pride while sellers saw little reason to give away value.\n* Moreover, a healthy stock market in 2023 exacerbated the yawning gap between private and public market valuations. With stocks trading well, sellers and their shareholders preferred to hold on to assets rather than face dilution from selling at a depressed multiple.\n* Finally, private equity exits were down 44% in value and 22% in volume. Besides cutting off a source of potentially attractive targets, deferred private equity exits meant that there were fewer marks for fair market value, further clouding price transparency.\nFigure 2\n*\n*\n*\nStrategic deal multiples have plummeted for the second year in a row, even as public market valuations rebounded\nAnother factor behind fewer deals is increased scrutiny by regulators around the globe. The European Commission, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, and the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have eyed major mergers with skepticism, particularly tech and healthcare tie-ups. A total of $361 billion in deals have been challenged since 2022; most have closed, often with remedies. The dust has not yet settled on the evolving antitrust regulatory landscape as courts weigh in and new guidelines are proposed. National security concerns also remain a factor for sensitive sectors such as semiconductors or nuclear energy. In this environment, some deals may never get off the ground; others are more likely to be abandoned in the face of a challenge. We explore the impact of longer and more uncertain timelines in “Regulation and M&A: How Scrutiny Raises the Bar for Acquirers.”\nLooking beneath the surface\nAcross industries, the collapse of tech M&A was the biggest drag on strategic M&A in 2023 (see Figure 3). Tech deal values declined by roughly 45% as median valuations, defined by enterprise value–to-EBITDA multiples, tumbled from 2021’s high of 25 times to 13 times last year. Emerson’s acquisition of National Instruments to expand automation capabilities and Cisco’s bid for Splunk for its cybersecurity capabilities point to the ongoing demand for high-quality (and profitable) tech assets. Yet, as we’ve explored elsewhere, a higher-for-longer interest rate environment changes the deal math for most tech deals predicated on growth over profitability (see Global M&A Report Midyear 2022 or M&A Midyear Report 2023: It Takes Two to Make a Market).\nFigure 3\n*\n*\n*\nHealthcare and life sciences as well as energy and natural resources M&A rebounded in 2023 but not enough to offset declines in tech and manufacturing\nAt the same time, a healthy dose of big-ticket deals supported a strong M&A year for energy and healthcare, prompted by differing sector dynamics. On the back of rising commodity prices, scale deals in energy and natural resources led the pack, with two megadeals in oil and gas and three additional major tie-ups comprising a total of about $175 billion in deal value, according to Dealogic. Companies in healthcare and life sciences continued their pursuit of growth via scope deals as represented by AbbVie’s back-to-back deals for ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics in December and Merck’s earlier acquisition of Prometheus.\nThe year saw a common thread of vertical dealmaking. Companies navigating a shock to the profit pool, whether a shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles or the rise of the Internet as a distribution channel, have turned to M&A to transform. Automotive companies are doing deals, such as Stellantis’s investment in Lyten and Ford’s acquisition of Auto Motive Power, to secure access to critical charging technology and to invest in their own recharging grids. In media, the value chain has been redesigned through merging of content and distribution, leading to new strategies for partnerships and alliances.\nVertical M&A can also reflect adaptive strategies in the face of industry consolidation. In the US, healthcare payers are using M&A to build health delivery networks, as exemplified by CVS’s purchase of Oak Street Health this year.\nSpin-offs remained an essential tool in portfolio transformation as well. For example, Danaher continued its reorientation toward life sciences via a $23 billion spin-off of its water business (Veralto) while acquiring Abcam and its protein consumables business for $5.7 billion. Sanofi joined other healthcare companies in announcing the separation of its consumer health business. Spin-offs are exceedingly hard to get right, but top-quartile performers show how valuable they can be (see “When a Spin-Off Wins Big”).\nNotably, cross-border dealmaking was sustained as investors sought to enhance portfolios in more favorable markets. US buyers pursued more cross-border deals, up 34% in value, while domestic value rose 2%. Similarly, Brazil remained attractive to foreign investment, even as domestic dealmaking declined (see “M&A in Brazil: International Buyers Act While Domestic Acquirers Show Caution”). Asia saw a 60% increase in deals from the Middle East as sovereign wealth funds sought to build supply chains and facilitate energy transitions.\nAnd megadeals made a mark in the second half of 2023, a possible signal that dealmakers were ready to look forward. For M&A observers, the timing wasn’t too surprising. Many companies had sustained high levels of proactive deal screening and outside-in due diligence even as deal counts fell. Some deals, such as Chevron-Hess, were yearslong in the making if opportunistic in timing. Others, such as Carrier’s acquisition of Viessmann Climate Solutions, reflected a bet on long-term trends.\nFinally, the year 2023 showed us a widening of the gap between how frequent acquirers and their inactive peers behave in M&A downcycles. You have heard us say more than once that frequent acquirers outperform throughout all economic cycles and tend to stay in the market through good times and bad (see “M&A in Times of Turbulence: Lessons from the Last Recession”). When we look back to the Covid-19 period, for example, we see that most frequent acquirers never stopped doing deals even as the market overall contracted. The same held true with the current market drop that began with the introduction of higher interest rates in June 2022 (see Figure 4). Most frequent acquirers kept acquiring.\nFigure 4\n*\n*\n*\nFrequent acquirers stayed in the game throughout recent times of turbulence\nPerhaps counterintuitively, today’s down market signals a longer-term fundamental shift: Those frequent acquirers that stay active are pulling away from less acquisitive or inactive companies as measured by long-term total shareholder returns. Bain research shows that the benefits of frequency are only increasing over time. While others stay on the sidelines, it is companies that invest to acquire through cycles, deploying tested and tailored toolkits to transform their businesses, that ultimately emerge as the winners.\nKudos to frequent acquirers that stay in the game through thick and thin.\nIn the following chapter, we discuss how the 2023 M&A market dynamic has created a growing backlog of deals that await any sign that buyers and sellers can come to terms.\n* Acknowledgments (click to expand)\nThis report was prepared by the leadership team of Bain & Company’s Global M&A and Divestitures practice, with special direction from Les Baird, partner; David Harding, advisory partner; Dale Stafford, partner; Kai Grass, partner; Suzanne Kumar, practice vice president; Lindsey White, senior manager; and an editorial team led by David Diamond.\nThe authors wish to thank the many members of the Bain leadership team who contributed articles to this year’s report. Additionally, we wish to thank the following colleagues for their help with this report: Bain Partners Harshveer Singh, Peter Horsley, and Colleen von Eckartsberg; Practice Managers Dwight Stalls and Anna Nowak-Dzialak; Practice Senior Analyst Amol Mathur; Consultants Shane Porter and Aysha Rashid; Senior Associate Consultant Jayson Chung; and Associate Consultant Katie Jones. This work additionally benefited from the support of Bain Capability Network’s Abhishek Jain, Roopam Kalra, Chhavi Khandelwal, Sanya Kataria, Yashovardhan Dey, and Suprakash Gosh.\n* Methodology (click to expand)\nState of the market, industry, and regional M&A data\nDeal details and aggregate statistics (such as value, volume, and multiples) were sourced primarily from Dealogic’s M&A database for this annual report. Data in most industry and regional articles includes the time period from January 1 to September 31, 2023. Forecasts for fourth quarter 2023 were conducted on a straight-line basis using first-quarter through third-quarter data unless an exception is noted. Full-year 2023 data was updated as of January 2024.\nThis report concentrates on strategic M&A, encompassing deals by corporate buyers (including sponsor exits) and private equity add-on acquisitions. Both types share fundamentally strategic objectives. Financial sponsors, special purpose acquisition companies, and venture capital fall under the nonstrategic category. Combined, these categories constitute Dealogic's total M&A market. All deal values represent either the disclosed value at the time of announcement (including debt for deals that have not closed) or the disclosed value at close for accurate assessment and representation of deal prices. The region and industry of each deal is classified according to the target’s region and industry unless an exception is noted.\nScale vs. scope\nThe M&A report signifies scale and scope deals in our chapters’ analyses to discern trends. Assessing deals through these lenses offers crucial insights into M&A market theses and themes.\nTo understand the nature of M&A activity, we ﬁrst identiﬁed the top strategic deals for each year. From the initial list of deals with values greater than $1 billion, as reported by Dealogic, we excluded nonstrategic deals. These include asset or property acquisitions, ﬁnancial investments, internal reorganizations, and minority stake acquisitions. This resulted in a total of 2,218 deals for the period between first quarter 2015 and third quarter 2023.\nWe then classiﬁed the strategic deals into scale or scope deals based on our proprietary database criteria applied consistently across the years. The proprietary criteria use the stated strategic rationale by the acquirer at the time of announcement to identify the key elements of the deal thesis. Based on these elements, the deals were categorized as scale or scope deals.\nScale deals are intended to strengthen market leadership and lower cost position through beneﬁts of scale, such as cost synergies. Scope deals are intended to accelerate top-line growth by entering or expanding into faster-growing market segments, or by bringing in new capabilities (see Exhibit A).\nExhibit A\n+\n+\n+\nAbout the methodology\nThe M&A Practitioners’ 2024 Outlook Survey\nIn partnership with the Gerson Lehrman Group, AlphaSights, and IncQuery, we conducted a survey of 306 M&A practitioners. The survey ran in October 2023 in the US, Canada, Brazil, UK, Germany, France, Japan, India, and Australia. Survey participants held senior executive roles with titles such as vice president, senior vice president/executive vice president, director, C-suite, or owner at companies with greater than $100 million in annual revenue that closed an M&A deal within the past three years, and they were responsible for M&A decision-making processes at their company.\nRegulation database of major deals\nBain has created a proprietary database of major deals that received scrutiny by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), US Department of Justice (DOJ), UK Competition and Markets Authority, or European Commission. For the purposes of this report, the database includes 42 deals announced between 2022 and 2023. Scrutiny is defined as an official second request, investigation, or litigation by a regulatory body. Deal status was last updated on December 18, 2023. This information allowed us to analyze the effects of regulatory challenges on the M&A deal timeline. For some analysis, deals announced during the prior six-month period were excluded to account for pending timelines.\nOur database also includes merger enforcement actions from the FTC and DOJ. This includes 204 merger cases in which a complaint was filed in federal court or the FTC's internal administrative court from January 1, 2015, through December 15, 2023. This allowed us to analyze historic changes in challenge timelines for scrutinized US deals. Deal status was last updated on December 15, 2023, with this date used as the resolution date for any deals pending at the time of analysis.\nRead the Next Chapter\nLooking Ahead: How the Big Backlog Will Shape the 2024 M&A Agenda\nRead our 2024 M&A Report\nDownload the PDF Explore the report\nAuthors\n* David Harding\nAdvisory Partner, Boston\n* Dale Stafford\nPartner, Washington, DC\n+\n* Kai Grass\nPartner, Dusseldorf\n+\n* Suzanne Kumar\nPractice Vice President, New York\n+\n* Lindsey White\nSenior Manager, Atlanta\n+\nContact us\nRelated Consulting Services\n* Mergers and Acquisitions\n* Strategy\nM&A Report\nBanking M&A\nIn a tough year, banks turned to M&A to secure themselves or position themselves to grow.\nMore\nM&A Report\nRegulation and M&A: How Scrutiny Raises the Bar for Acquirers\nAs regulatory review periods get longer and less certain, companies must elevate their deal strategy and integration approach.\nMore\nM&A Report\nAutomotive and Mobility M&A\nCompanies are turning to M&A to ensure access to critical capacities and materials in the value chain.\nMore\nM&A Report\nWhen Buying (vs. Building) Is the Right Move for Engine 2\nThree ways that companies turn to M&A to scale new businesses faster, cheaper, and more effectively.\nMore\nM&A Report\nInsurance M&A\nInstead of building or buying, many insurers are testing the waters with partnerships.\nMore\nOverview\n* Looking Back at M&A in 2023: Who Wins in a Down Year?\n* Looking Ahead: How the Big Backlog Will Shape the 2024 M&A Agenda\nHot Topics\n* Generative AI in M&A: Where Hope Meets Hype\n* Regulation and M&A: How Scrutiny Raises the Bar for Acquirers\nIndustry Views\n* Aerospace and Defense M&A\n* Automotive and Mobility M&A\n* Banking M&A\n* Building Products M&A\n* Consumer Products M&A\n* Energy and Natural Resources M&A\n* Healthcare and Life Sciences M&A\n* Insurance M&A\n* Media M&A\n* Payments M&A\n* Retail M&A\n* Technology M&A\n* Telecommunications M&A\n* Wealth and Asset Management M&A\nRegional Perspectives\n* Brazil M&A\n* India M&A\n* Japan M&A\n* Middle East M&A\nTags\n* M&A Report\n* Mergers and Acquisitions\n* Strategy\nHow We've Helped Clients\nStrategy Global expansion boosts supermarket earnings and growth\nRead case study\nStrategy Transforming a leading polymers maker into a profit powerhouse\nRead case study\nSales and Marketing Food Co. jump-starts growth with return to core brands\nRead case study\nReady to talk?\nI want to talk to your experts in: Select an industry Advanced Manufacturing & Services Aerospace, Defense & Government Services Agribusiness Automotive & Mobility Aviation Chemicals Consumer Products Energy & Natural Resources Financial Services Forest Products, Paper & Packaging Healthcare & Life Sciences Infrastructure, Construction & Building Products Machinery & Equipment Media & Entertainment Metals Mining Oil & Gas Private Equity Real Estate Retail Social & Public Sector Technology Telecommunications Transportation Travel & Leisure Utilities & Renewables Please select an industry from the dropdown list\nWe work with ambitious leaders who want to define the future, not hide from it.

        "text": "The global space economy grew 8% to $546 billion in 2022 and is projected to climb another 41% over the next five years, according to a leading space nonprofit. \nThe sector is expected to show resiliency in the coming years, despite uncertainty about the global economy and a recent slowdown in space investment.\nCompanies are seeing continued revenue growth from commercial space assets and governments around the world boosting expenditures, according to a report from the Space Foundation, a Colorado Springs, Colorado-based space flight advocacy group. The analysis considered spending from 51 governments, as well as commercial revenue from companies in 11 space industry sub-sectors.\n“Commercial space is the vital growing sector of the overall space economy,” Lesley Conn, director of research and digital programming at the Space Foundation, said in an interview. “Within five years, certainly you’re going to see a real acceleration and an expansion of space and space assets.”\nCompanies in the space industry grew revenue to $427.6 billion in 2022, up from a revised $396.2 billion the year before. One-third of that flowed from infrastructure and support for activities in space, such as ground stations used for satellite communication. The remaining came from space-based products — namely satellites. The single biggest business was the sale of position, navigation and timing, or PNT, satellite data, which made up 39% of all commercial revenue.\nThat resilience reflects in part the long development lead times of space programs and the prevalence of public-private partnerships, the report said. Those attributes help sustain funding, even when the economy is uneven.\nThe growth in 2022 came despite venture capital volatility as markets reacted to rising interest rates and access to funding grew scarce for many startups. Private investment flows into space ventures slowed to $20 billion last year, down from a record $47.4 billion in 2021, according to a separate report from Space Capital, a venture capital firm that invests exclusively in space-based technology. \n SpaceX Setting Pace\nCommercial revenue grew hand-in-hand with a surge in orbital launches. A total of 186 launches were attempted in 2022, up from 145 the previous year, the Space Foundation said. Commercial launches accounted for 81 of those, 50 of which were conducted by Elon Musk’s industry-leading SpaceX. The company’s launch cadence has increased substantially in recent years as it launches batches of its own Starlink satellites into space to provide global broadband internet coverage to Earth.\nSpending by governments on space programs grew 8% to a combined $119 billion last year, below the 22% gain in 2021. The Space Foundation projects the pace of public sector outlays on space will pick up this year as nations work toward exploring the moon and prioritize large satellite constellations with military applications. NASA is moving ahead on its Artemis program, which has the goal of sending the first woman to the moon’s surface. China also has plans to land humans there.\nThe US dominated civil and defense spending in space, comprising nearly 60% of total spending. China followed in second place, accounting for 14%, according to the Space Foundation’s analysis, which relied on a GDP calculation that estimated the country’s spending on space. The European Space Agency ranked third with 5% of the total. While those three have been top players for a while, more countries are contributing to overall space spending than in the past. \n“Not only are governments who have been in space increasing their spending, but more and more nations are joining and becoming a part of space,” said Conn, noting that some 92 nations now have satellites in orbit.

        "text": ".  \nIn this article we delve into the aerospace industry and gain valuable insight by utilizing AAII’s A+ Investor Stock Grades, all while pondering astronaut Sally Ride’s words: “The stars don’t look bigger, but they do look brighter.” With the future of aerospace in mind, let’s assess whether three aerospace giants—Boeing , Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman—are worthy contenders for your investment consideration.\nAerospace Stocks Recent News\nThe aerospace industry is a dynamic and vital sector that encompasses a wide range of activities related to the design, development, manufacturing and operation of aircraft, spacecraft and associated technologies. It plays a critical role in shaping modern transportation, defense systems, communications and scientific exploration. This industry brings together engineering, innovation and cutting-edge technology to push the boundaries of human capability and exploration beyond Earth’s atmosphere.\nThe global aerospace market was valued at $855.6 billion in 2023 and, according to Business Research Co., it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% from 2023 to 2027. This would value the market at more than $1.1 trillion by 2027. North America dominates the market with over 38.7% market share, driven by NASA’s significant space exploration spending and commercial investments. Despite uncertainties surrounding the global economy and a recent deceleration in space investment, the sector is anticipated to display resilience in the forthcoming years.\nCommercial enterprises prioritize investments that deliver returns within the lifetime of their shareholders, considering factors such as return on investment (ROI), time to achieve returns and the likelihood of research and development (R&amp;D) success. Conversely, governments enjoy the advantage of taking a long-term perspective, spanning decades or even centuries, as their decisions transcend generations, allowing for a more patient approach to investment choices. In 2022, global government expenditure on space programs reached a record of $103 billion. The U.S. government led the world in space expenditure, allocating nearly $62 billion to its space programs. Following closely behind was China, with government expenditure on space programs amounting to almost $12 billion.\nThe growth in this evolving market is driven by the U.S. government’s support for private companies and their encouragement of innovation. Space-related expenditures increased 3% in fiscal-year 2022, reaching $24 billion, and the Biden administration aims to further boost it by 8% in fiscal-year 2023, approaching $26 billion. These investments have spurred innovation and resulted in a substantial rise in orbital launches, with 145 reported in 2021, a 27% increase from the previous year. The momentum continued with 125 launches in the first three quarters of 2022.\nThe aerospace industry is poised for a promising future, with companies set to reap the rewards of reduced material costs and advancements in technology. While new space start-ups present inherent risks, long-established and secure companies hold the advantage in this competitive market. Now, let us turn our focus to the key players positioned to make the most significant impact in this thriving arena.\nGrading Aerospace Stocks With AAII’s A+ Stock Grades\nWhen analyzing a company, it is helpful to have an objective framework that allows you to compare companies in the same way. This is why AAII created the A+ Stock Grades, which evaluate companies across five factors that research and real-world investment results indicate to identify market-beating stocks in the long run: value, growth, momentum, earnings estimate revisions (and surprises) and quality.\nUsing AAII’s A+ Stock Grades, the following table summarizes the attractiveness of three athleisure stocks—Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman—based on their fundamentals.\n AAII’s A+ Stock Grade Summary for Three Aerospace Stocks    American Association of Individual Investors  \nWhat the A+ Stock Grades Reveal\n Boeing Co. (BA) is an aerospace company. Its segments include commercial airplanes (BCA), defense, space &amp; security (BDS), global services (BGS) and Boeing Capital (BCC). Its BCA segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Its commercial jet aircraft in production include the 737 narrow-body model and the 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. Its BDS segment is engaged in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems. Its BGS segment offers aerospace platforms and systems with a range of products and services, including supply chain and logistics management, engineering, maintenance and modifications, upgrades and conversions, spare parts, pilot and others. Its BCC segment’s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, sales-type/finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.\nThe company has a Value Grade of D, based on its Value Score of 22, which is considered expensive. Boeing’s Value Score ranking is based on several traditional valuation metrics. The company has a percentile rank of 52 for the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and a rank of 100 for the ratio of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/Ebotda), with lower rank indicating better value. The company has a shareholder yield of –1.5%, meaning it is increasing the number of shares available to purchase. Boeing has a price-to-sales ratio of 1.96.\nThe Value Grade is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of the valuation metrics mentioned above, along with the price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) ratio, price-to-book-value (P/B) ratio and the price-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nA higher-quality stock possesses traits associated with upside potential and reduced downside risk. Backtesting of the Quality Grade shows that stocks with higher grades, on average, outperformed stocks with lower grades over the period from 1998 through 2019.\nBoeing has a Quality Grade of C with a score of 49, which is average. The A+ Quality Grade is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of return on assets (ROA), return on invested capital (ROIC), gross profit to assets, buyback yield, change in total liabilities to assets, accruals to assets, Z double prime bankruptcy risk (Z) score and F-Score. The score is variable, meaning it can consider all eight measures or, should any of the eight measures not be valid, the valid remaining measures. To be assigned a Quality Score, though, stocks must have a valid (non-null) measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures.\nThe company ranks weakly in terms of its gross income to assets and buyback yield. Boeing has gross income to assets of 3.6% and a buyback yield of –1.5%. The sector median gross income to assets is 23.6% and the median buyback yield is –0.3% for the sector. The company has an F-Score of 5, ranking it in the 61st percentile of all stocks. The F-Score is a number between 0 and 9 that assesses the strength of a company’s financial position. It considers the profitability, leverage, liquidity and operating efficiency of a company.\nBoeing has a Momentum Grade of A, based on its Momentum Score of 82. This means that it has very strong weighted relative strength over the last four quarters. This score is derived from an above-average relative price strength of 5.3% in the most recent quarter, –5.6% in the second-most-recent quarter and 41.6% in the third-most-recent quarter, offset by below-average relative price strength of –10.0% in the fourth-most-recent quarter. The scores are 69, 65, 92 and 36 sequentially from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is 7.3%, which translates to a score of 82. The weighted four-quarter relative strength rank is the relative price change for each of the past four quarters, with the most recent quarterly price change given a weight of 40% and each of the three previous quarters given a weighting of 20%.\n Lockheed Martin (LMT) is a security and aerospace company. It operates through four segments. The aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, support and upgrade of military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. The missiles and fire control segment provides air and missile defense systems; fire control systems; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. The rotary and mission systems segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea- and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, sea- and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions and simulation and training solutions. The space segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, strike and defensive systems.\nEarnings estimate revisions offer an indication of how analysts view the short-term prospects of a firm. Lockheed Martin has an Earnings Estimate Revisions Grade of C, which is neutral. The grade is based on the statistical significance of its latest two quarterly earnings surprises and the percentage change in its consensus estimate for the current fiscal year over the past month and past three months.\nLockheed Martin reported an earnings surprise of 2.8% for second-quarter 2023, and in the prior quarter reported a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%. Over the last month, the consensus earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2023 has decreased from $6.740 to $6.665 per share due to four upward and 13 downward revisions. Over the last month, the consensus earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2024 has remained relatively flat, decreasing slightly from $27.16 to $27.14 per share, based on 12 upward revisions and seven downward revisions.\nLockheed Martin has a Momentum Grade of C, based on its Momentum Score of 51. This means that it has average weighted relative price strength over the last four quarters. This score is derived from an above-average relative price strength of –2.0% in the second-most-recent quarter and 22.3% in the fourth-most-recent quarter, offset by below-average relative price strength of –11.6% in the most recent quarter and –8.6% in the third-most-recent quarter. The scores are 34, 71, 32 and 88 sequentially from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is –2.3%, which translates to a score of 51.\nThe company has a Value Grade of D, based on its Value Score of 39, which is considered expensive. This is derived from a high price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 40.0 and a high price-to-book-value ratio of 12.35. In addition, Lockheed Martin has a Growth Grade of A, which is considered very strong. This is derived from a high five-year annualized sales growth rate of 5.7%, along with four of the five past years resulting in year-over-year increases in sales and positive cash from operations in each of the last five fiscal years.\n Northrop Grumman (NOC) is a global aerospace and defense technology company. It operates through four segments: aeronautics systems, defense systems, mission systems and space systems. The aeronautics systems segment is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, other U.S. government agencies and international customers. The defense systems segment is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of weapon and mission systems for U.S. military and civilian agency customers, and a range of international customers. The mission systems segment is engaged in advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems. The space systems segment is engaged in the design, development, integration, production and operation of space, missile defense, launch and strategic missile systems.\nNorthrop Grumman has a Quality Grade of B, with a score of 72. The company ranks strongly in terms of its return on assets and buyback yield. Northrop Grumman has return on assets of 10.5% and a buyback yield of 2.4%. The sector median for return on assets is only 3.0%.\nNorthrop Grumman has a Value Grade of D, based on a score of 35. The company has a percentile rank of 44 for the price-earnings ratio and a rank of 50 for the price-to-sales ratio. A lower price-earnings ratio is considered a better value, as investors are paying less for the same level of earnings. Northrop Grumman’s price-earnings ratio is 14.9, below the sector median of 20.2. The enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio is 16.2, which ranks in the 73rd percentile of all stocks.\nNorthrop Grumman has a Growth Grade of A and ranks in the 90th percentile among all U.S.-listed stocks. The company has increased its sales in four of the last five years, along with having positive cash from operations in five of the last five years. The company has a five-year average sales growth rate of 7.1%, which is slightly below the sector median of 7.4%.\n ____ \n The stocks meeting the criteria of the approach do not represent a “recommended” or “buy” list.

To be assigned a Quality Score, though, stocks must have a valid (non-null) measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures.\nThe company ranks weakly in terms of its gross income to assets and buyback yield. Boeing has gross income to assets of 3.6% and a buyback yield of –1.5%. The sector median gross income to assets is 23.6% and the median buyback yield is –0.3% for the sector. The company has an F-Score of 5, ranking it in the 61st percentile of all stocks. The F-Score is a number between 0 and 9 that assesses the strength of a company’s financial position. It considers the profitability, leverage, liquidity and operating efficiency of a company.\nBoeing has a Momentum Grade of A, based on its Momentum Score of 82. This means that it has very strong weighted relative strength over the last four quarters. This score is derived from an above-average relative price strength of 5.3% in the most recent quarter, –5.6% in the second-most-recent quarter and 41.6% in the third-most-recent quarter, offset by below-average relative price strength of –10.0% in the fourth-most-recent quarter. The scores are 69, 65, 92 and 36 sequentially from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is 7.3%, which translates to a score of 82. The weighted four-quarter relative strength rank is the relative price change for each of the past four quarters, with the most recent quarterly price change given a weight of 40% and each of the three previous quarters given a weighting of 20%.\nLockheed Martin (LMT) is a security and aerospace company. It operates through four segments. The aeronautics segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, support and upgrade of military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. The missiles and fire control segment provides air and missile defense systems; fire control systems; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. The rotary and mission systems segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea- and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, sea- and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions and simulation and training solutions. The space segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, strike and defensive systems.\nEarnings estimate revisions offer an indication of how analysts view the short-term prospects of a firm. Lockheed Martin has an Earnings Estimate Revisions Grade of C, which is neutral. The grade is based on the statistical significance of its latest two quarterly earnings surprises and the percentage change in its consensus estimate for the current fiscal year over the past month and past three months.\nLockheed Martin reported an earnings surprise of 2.8% for second-quarter 2023, and in the prior quarter reported a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%. Over the last month, the consensus earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2023 has decreased from $6.740 to $6.665 per share due to four upward and 13 downward revisions. Over the last month, the consensus earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2024 has remained relatively flat, decreasing slightly from $27.16 to $27.14 per share, based on 12 upward revisions and seven downward revisions.\nLockheed Martin has a Momentum Grade of C, based on its Momentum Score of 51. This means that it has average weighted relative price strength over the last four quarters. This score is derived from an above-average relative price strength of –2.0% in the second-most-recent quarter and 22.3% in the fourth-most-recent quarter, offset by below-average relative price strength of –11.6% in the most recent quarter and –8.6% in the third-most-recent quarter. The scores are 34, 71, 32 and 88 sequentially from the most recent quarter. The weighted four-quarter relative price strength is –2.3%, which translates to a score of 51.\nThe company has a Value Grade of D, based on its Value Score of 39, which is considered expensive. This is derived from a high price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 40.0 and a high price-to-book-value ratio of 12.35. In addition, Lockheed Martin has a Growth Grade of A, which is considered very strong. This is derived from a high five-year annualized sales growth rate of 5.7%, along with four of the five past years resulting in year-over-year increases in sales and positive cash from operations in each of the last five fiscal years.\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) is a global aerospace and defense technology company. It operates through four segments: aeronautics systems, defense systems, mission systems and space systems. The aeronautics systems segment is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, other U.S. government agencies and international customers. The defense systems segment is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of weapon and mission systems for U.S. military and civilian agency customers, and a range of international customers. The mission systems segment is engaged in advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems. The space systems segment is engaged in the design, development, integration, production and operation of space, missile defense, launch and strategic missile systems.\nNorthrop Grumman has a Quality Grade of B, with a score of 72. The company ranks strongly in terms of its return on assets and buyback yield. Northrop Grumman has return on assets of 10.5% and a buyback yield of 2.4%. The sector median for return on assets is only 3.0%.\nNorthrop Grumman has a Value Grade of D, based on a score of 35. The company has a percentile rank of 44 for the price-earnings ratio and a rank of 50 for the price-to-sales ratio. A lower price-earnings ratio is considered a better value, as investors are paying less for the same level of earnings. Northrop Grumman’s price-earnings ratio is 14.9, below the sector median of 20.2. The enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio is 16.2, which ranks in the 73rd percentile of all stocks.\nNorthrop Grumman has a Growth Grade of A and ranks in the 90th percentile among all U.S.-listed stocks. The company has increased its sales in four of the last five years, along with having positive cash from operations in five of the last five years. The company has a five-year average sales growth rate of 7.1%, which is slightly below the sector median of 7.4%.\n____\nThe stocks meeting the criteria of the approach do not represent a “recommended” or “buy” list.

        "text": "Getty Images  \n  Boeing\n BA (NYSE: BA) reported its Q3 results last week, with revenues slightly above but earnings missing the street estimates. We believe BA stock has ample room for growth, as discussed below. The company reported revenue of $18.1 billion and an adjusted loss of $3.26 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $18.0 billion in sales and $2.96 loss per share. In this note, we discuss Boeing’s stock performance, key takeaways from its recent results, and valuation.\nBA stock has seen a decline of 10% from levels of $215 in early January 2021 to around $190 now, vs. an increase of about 15% for the S&amp;P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the decrease in BA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were -6% in 2021, -5% in 2022, and 1% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&amp;P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 13% in 2023 - indicating that BA underperformed the S&amp;P in 2021 and 2023.\nIn fact, consistently beating the S&amp;P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Industrials sector, including UNP, HON, and UPS, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT.\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could BA face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&amp;P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? From a valuation perspective, BA stock looks like it has room for growth. We estimate  Boeing’s Valuation  to be $235 per share, reflecting more than 20% upside from its current levels of $192. Our forecast is based on 1.9x revenues for BA, aligning with its last five-year average. We expect 2023 sales to be around $73 billion for the company and an adjusted loss of $5.85 per share, compared to $66.6 billion in sales and $11.06 loss per share in 2022.\n Boeing’s revenue of $18.1 billion in Q3 was up 13% y-o-y, primarily due to 25% growth in commercial airplanes, while global services segment sales were up 9%, and defense, space, and security revenue was up 3%. Commercial airplane deliveries declined 6% y-o-y to 105 in Q3. The company lowered its 2023 delivery outlook to 375-400 737 aircraft compared to its prior guidance of 400-450. This can be attributed to fuselage-related issues in production. The company’s core operating margin stood at -6.6% in Q3 versus -19.2% in the prior-year quarter. Boeing’s adjusted loss of $3.26 per share in Q3 narrowed from $6.18 in the prior year quarter.\nAlthough there are near-term headwinds for Boeing, its long-term growth prospects look solid, with a backlog of $469 billion. The company should be able to sort its production issues and ramp up production for 737 aircraft in the coming quarters. We estimate positive earnings of $4.07 in 2024, and the bottom line will likely see robust growth in the coming years. There is a strong demand for new aircraft from airlines, which will bode well for Boeing.\nWhile BA stock looks like it can see higher levels, it is helpful to see how  Boeing’s Peers  fare on metrics that matter.

        "text": "735 commercial aircraft delivered  Revenues € 65.4 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 5.8 billion EBIT (reported) € 4.6 billion; EPS (reported) € 4.80 Free cash flow before M&amp;A and customer financing € 4.4 billion; Net cash € 10.7 billion 2023 guidance achieved Dividend proposals: dividend of € 1.80 per share; special dividend of € 1.00 per share 2024 guidance issued   Amsterdam, 15 February 2024 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated Full-Year (FY) 2023 financial results and provided guidance for 2024. “In 2023 we recorded strong order intake across all our businesses and we delivered on our commitments. This was a significant achievement given the complexity of the operating environment,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to invest in our global industrial system, while progressing on our transformation and decarbonisation journey. Our dividend proposals are a reflection of the strong 2023 financials, our growth prospects in 2024 and balance sheet strength.” Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 2,319 (2022: 1,078 aircraft) with net orders of 2,094 aircraft after cancellations (2022: 820 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 8,598 commercial aircraft at the end of 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 393 net orders (2022: 362 units), which were well spread across programmes and corresponds to a book-to-bill ratio above 1 both in units and value. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased 15 percent to € 15.7 billion (2022: € 13.7 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill of around 1.4 by value. Fourth quarter orders included 16 C295 aircraft for Spain. Consolidated order intake by value increased to € 186.5 billion (2022: € 82.5 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 554 billion at the end of 2023 (year-end 2022: € 449 billion). The increase in the consolidated backlog value mainly reflects the Company-wide book-to-bill of well above 1, partly offset by the weakening of the US dollar. Consolidated revenues increased 11 percent year-on-year to € 65.4 billion (2022: € 58.8 billion). A total of 735 commercial aircraft were delivered (2022: 661(1) aircraft), comprising 68 A220s, 571 A320 Family, 32 A330s and 64 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 15 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries were stable at 346 units (2022: 344 units) with revenues rising 4 percent, reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 2 percent, mainly driven by Military Air Systems and Connected Intelligence, offset by some updated Estimates at Completion of certain Space programmes. A total of 8 A400M military airlifters were delivered (2022: 10 aircraft). Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 5,838 million (2022: € 5,627 million). EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 4,818 million (2022: € 4,600 million), reflecting the higher deliveries and a more favourable hedge rate, partially offset by investments for preparing the future. FY 2022 included the non-recurring positive impacts from retirement obligations and compliance-related topics partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia, while in H1 2023 provisions were released for € 0.1 billion from compliance-related topics. The A220 ramp-up continues towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026, with a focus on the programme's industrial maturity and financial performance. On the A320 Family programme, production is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. In 2023, construction of the second A320 Final Assembly capacities in Tianjin (China) and Mobile (US) commenced and the new A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Toulouse delivered its first aircraft in December. The first customer A321XLR entered into the Final Assembly Line in December, with entry-into-service for the aircraft type expected to take place in Q3 2024. On widebody aircraft, the Company continues towards a monthly rate of 4 aircraft for the A330 in 2024 and rate 10 in 2026 for the A350. Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 735 million (2022: € 639 million), reflecting the strong performance across programmes and services. FY 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements. EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 229 million (2022: € 384 million). The decrease reflects € 0.6 billion charges resulting from the update of Estimates at Completion of certain Space programmes, partially mitigated by the performance of the rest of the business. FY 2022 included some non-recurring elements, notably from the loss of two Pleiades Neo satellites. On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In 2023, an additional update of the contract estimate at completion has been performed and a net charge of € 41 million recorded. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline. Consolidated self-financed R&amp;D expenses totalled € 3,257 million (2022: € 3,079 million). Consolidated EBIT (reported) amounted to € 4,603 million (2022: € 5,325 million), including net Adjustments of € -1,235 million. These Adjustments comprised:  € -1,030 million related to the dollar working capital mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -224 million were in Q4. This mainly reflects the phasing impact arising from the difference between transaction date and delivery date; € -89 million related to the Aerostructures transformation, of which € -32 million were in Q4; € -41 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -41 million were in Q4; € -75 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -19 million were in Q4.  The financial result was € 166 million (2022: € -250 million). It mainly reflects a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(2)  was € 3,789 million (2022: € 4,247 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 4.80 (2022: € 5.40). Consolidated free cash flow before M&amp;A and customer financing was € 4,386 million (2022: € 4,680 million), mainly reflecting the level of commercial aircraft deliveries as well as the strong performance in all businesses. Consolidated free cash flow of € 3,885 million (2022: € 4,324 million) included € -65 million for M&amp;A activities and € -436 million of customer financing, mostly related to the planned execution of certain contractual obligations. The gross cash position stood at € 25.3 billion at the end of 2023 (year-end 2022: € 23.6 billion), with a consolidated net cash position of € 10.7 billion (year-end 2022: € 9.4 billion). The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2023 dividend of € 1.80 per share (2022: € 1.80 per share) and a special dividend of € 1.00 per share to the 2024 Annual General Meeting taking place on 10 April 2024. The proposed payment date is 18 April 2024.  Outlook  As the basis for its 2024 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services. The Company’s 2024 guidance is before M&amp;A. On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2024:  Around 800 commercial aircraft deliveries; EBIT Adjusted between € 6.5 billion and € 7.0 billion; Free Cash Flow before Customer Financing(3) of around € 4.0 billion.

Airbus reports Full-Year (FY) 2023 results\n15 February 2024\nCompany\nAirbus reports Full-Year (FY) 2023 results\n* 735 commercial aircraft delivered\n* Revenues € 65.4 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 5.8 billion\n* EBIT (reported) € 4.6 billion; EPS (reported) € 4.80\n* Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 4.4 billion; Net cash € 10.7 billion\n* 2023 guidance achieved\n* Dividend proposals: dividend of € 1.80 per share; special dividend of € 1.00 per share\n* 2024 guidance issued\nAmsterdam, 15 February 2024 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated Full-Year (FY) 2023 financial results and provided guidance for 2024.\n“In 2023 we recorded strong order intake across all our businesses and we delivered on our commitments. This was a significant achievement given the complexity of the operating environment,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to invest in our global industrial system, while progressing on our transformation and decarbonisation journey. Our dividend proposals are a reflection of the strong 2023 financials, our growth prospects in 2024 and balance sheet strength.”\nGross commercial aircraft orders totalled 2,319 (2022: 1,078 aircraft) with net orders of 2,094 aircraft after cancellations (2022: 820 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 8,598 commercial aircraft at the end of 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 393 net orders (2022: 362 units), which were well spread across programmes and corresponds to a book-to-bill ratio above 1 both in units and value. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased 15 percent to € 15.7 billion (2022: € 13.7 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill of around 1.4 by value. Fourth quarter orders included 16 C295 aircraft for Spain.\nConsolidated order intake by value increased to € 186.5 billion (2022: € 82.5 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 554 billion at the end of 2023 (year-end 2022: € 449 billion). The increase in the consolidated backlog value mainly reflects the Company-wide book-to-bill of well above 1, partly offset by the weakening of the US dollar.\nConsolidated revenues increased 11 percent year-on-year to € 65.4 billion (2022: € 58.8 billion). A total of 735 commercial aircraft were delivered (2022: 661(1) aircraft), comprising 68 A220s, 571 A320 Family, 32 A330s and 64 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 15 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries were stable at 346 units (2022: 344 units) with revenues rising 4 percent, reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 2 percent, mainly driven by Military Air Systems and Connected Intelligence, offset by some updated Estimates at Completion of certain Space programmes. A total of 8 A400M military airlifters were delivered (2022: 10 aircraft).\nConsolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 5,838 million (2022: € 5,627 million).\nEBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 4,818 million (2022: € 4,600 million), reflecting the higher deliveries and a more favourable hedge rate, partially offset by investments for preparing the future. FY 2022 included the non-recurring positive impacts from retirement obligations and compliance-related topics partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia, while in H1 2023 provisions were released for € 0.1 billion from compliance-related topics.\nThe A220 ramp-up continues towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026, with a focus on the programme's industrial maturity and financial performance. On the A320 Family programme, production is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. In 2023, construction of the second A320 Final Assembly capacities in Tianjin (China) and Mobile (US) commenced and the new A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Toulouse delivered its first aircraft in December. The first customer A321XLR entered into the Final Assembly Line in December, with entry-into-service for the aircraft type expected to take place in Q3 2024.\nOn widebody aircraft, the Company continues towards a monthly rate of 4 aircraft for the A330 in 2024 and rate 10 in 2026 for the A350.\nAirbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 735 million (2022: € 639 million), reflecting the strong performance across programmes and services. FY 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.\nEBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 229 million (2022: € 384 million).\nThe decrease reflects € 0.6 billion charges resulting from the update of Estimates at Completion of certain Space programmes, partially mitigated by the performance of the rest of the business. FY 2022 included some non-recurring elements, notably from the loss of two Pleiades Neo satellites.\nOn the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In 2023, an additional update of the contract estimate at completion has been performed and a net charge of € 41 million recorded. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline.\nConsolidated self-financed R&D expenses totalled € 3,257 million (2022: € 3,079 million).\nConsolidated EBIT (reported) amounted to € 4,603 million (2022: € 5,325 million), including net Adjustments of € -1,235 million.\nThese Adjustments comprised:\n* € -1,030 million related to the dollar working capital mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -224 million were in Q4. This mainly reflects the phasing impact arising from the difference between transaction date and delivery date;\n* € -89 million related to the Aerostructures transformation, of which € -32 million were in Q4;\n* € -41 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -41 million were in Q4;\n* € -75 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -19 million were in Q4.\nThe financial result was € 166 million (2022: € -250 million). It mainly reflects a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(2) was € 3,789 million (2022: € 4,247 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 4.80 (2022: € 5.40).\nConsolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was € 4,386 million (2022: € 4,680 million), mainly reflecting the level of commercial aircraft deliveries as well as the strong performance in all businesses. Consolidated free cash flow of € 3,885 million (2022: € 4,324 million) included € -65 million for M&A activities and € -436 million of customer financing, mostly related to the planned execution of certain contractual obligations. The gross cash position stood at € 25.3 billion at the end of 2023 (year-end 2022: € 23.6 billion), with a consolidated net cash position of € 10.7 billion (year-end 2022: € 9.4 billion).\nThe Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2023 dividend of € 1.80 per share (2022: € 1.80 per share) and a special dividend of € 1.00 per share to the 2024 Annual General Meeting taking place on 10 April 2024. The proposed payment date is 18 April 2024.\nOutlook\nAs the basis for its 2024 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.\nThe Company’s 2024 guidance is before M&A.\nOn that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2024:\n* Around 800 commercial aircraft deliveries;\n* EBIT Adjusted between € 6.5 billion and € 7.0 billion;\n* Free Cash Flow before Customer Financing(3) of around € 4.0 billion.\nNote to editors: Live Webcast of the Analyst Conference Call and Annual Press Conference\nAt 07:30 CET on 15 February 2024, you can follow the FY 2023 Results Analyst Conference Call via the Airbus website at https://www.airbus.com/en/investors.

It mainly reflects the increased commercial aircraft deliveries, a positive year-on-year impact from currency hedging and a good performance across programmes and services at Helicopters. It also reflects charges recorded in certain Space programmes, partially mitigated by the good performance of the rest of the business at Defence and Space. Q4 2022 included non-recurring elements from the progress made on compliance-related topics, while Airbus Defence and Space was negatively impacted by the loss of the two Pleiades Neo satellites.\nQ4 2023 EBIT (reported) of € 1,891 million included net Adjustments of € -316 million.

It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules.\nAdjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses.\nEBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted , as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses.\nEPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of a basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation.\nGross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position).\nNet cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position).\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) - definition until 31 December 2023. For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities.\nFCF before M&A - definition until 31 December 2023. FCF before M&A refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses.\nFCF before M&A and Customer Financing - definition until 31 December 2023. FCF before M&A and Customer Financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) - definition from 1 January 2024. An alternative performance measure and key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated by its operations. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of (i) cash provided by operating activities and (ii) investments in intangible and fixed assets (net) & dividends paid by companies valued at equity, minus (iii) contribution to plan assets of pension schemes, (iv) realised foreign exchange results on treasury swaps and (v) change in cash from changes in consolidation.\nFCF before Customer Financing - definition from 1 January 2024. FCF before Customer Financing refers to free cash flow adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator used by the Company in its financial guidance.\nFootnotes:\n1. After a reduction of two aircraft previously recorded as sold in December 2021 for which a transfer was not possible due to international sanctions against Russia.\n2. Airbus SE continues to use the term Net Income/Loss. It is identical to Profit/Loss for the period attributable to equity owners of the parent as defined by IFRS Rules.\n3. The Company has decided to update the definition of the Alternative Performance Measure Free Cash Flow in line with market practices to better reflect the underlying cash generation performance of its operations. Going forward, Mergers and Acquisitions transactions will be excluded from this definition (see Glossary). This applies from 1 January 2024 onwards and the 2024 Guidance is issued on that basis.\n4.

        "text": "488 commercial aircraft delivered in 9m 2023   Revenues € 42.6 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 3.6 billion   EBIT (reported) € 2.7 billion; EPS (reported) € 2.96   Free cash flow before M&amp;A and customer financing € 1.0 billion   Charges on certain satellite development programmes   Guidance maintained    Amsterdam, 08 November 2023 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for the nine months ended 30 September 2023. “We continue to make progress on our operational plan in a global environment that has become increasingly complex. The nine-month earnings reflect higher commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance in helicopters as well as charges linked to the reassessment of certain satellite development programmes,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “Demand for our commercial aircraft is very strong with a continuing recovery in the widebody market. We expect the supply chain to remain challenging as we progress on the production ramp-up. In that context, we maintain our guidance for the full year.” Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 1,280 (9m 2022: 856 aircraft) with net orders of 1,241 aircraft after cancellations (9m 2022: 647 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,992 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 191 net orders (9m 2022: 246 units) which were well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 8.5 billion (9m 2022: € 8.0 billion), including the renewal of the in-service support contract for Germany’s A400M fleet. Consolidated revenues increased 12 percent year-on-year to € 42.6 billion (9m 2022: € 38.1 billion). A total of 488 commercial aircraft were delivered (9m 2022: 437(1)(2) aircraft), comprising 41 A220s, 391 A320 Family, 20 A330s and 36 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 18 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters’ deliveries increased slightly to 197 units (9m 2022: 193 units) with revenues rising 3 percent, reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 6 percent, mainly driven by a backloaded A400M delivery profile and updated Estimates at Completion of certain satellite development programmes. A total of 4 A400M military airlifters were delivered (9m 2022: 7 aircraft). Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – was € 3,631 million (9m 2022: € 3,481 million). EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 3,216 million (9m 2022: € 2,875 million), reflecting the higher deliveries and a more favourable hedge rate, partially offset by investments for preparing the future. 9m 2022 included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia. In H1 2023 provisions were released to reflect further progress made on compliance-related topics. The ramp-up on the A220 programme is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026. Production on the A320 Family programme is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. The modernisation and digitalisation of the industrial system continues, as illustrated by the inauguration of the A321XLR equipment installation hangar in Hamburg. The A321XLR is progressing towards certification, with entry-into-service expected to take place in Q2 2024. On"

        "text": "Today, we find ourselves engaged in a thrilling new space race. Private companies and governments have set truly audacious goals for returning to the moon, launching space tourism businesses, colonizing Mars, and eventually, exploring outer space beyond our solar system. The satellite field is undergoing a major renaissance as emerging technologies are helping established players and startups disrupt the space industry by delivering faster design cycles for space-based products such as satellites, more sophisticated payloads, and upgradeable communications systems. We’ve witnessed a steady ramp-up in innovation and non-government, private commercial investment in the satellite industry during the past five years. With so much rapid development underway, there’s a growing need for high-fidelity simulation and emulation, as well as testing expertise, to ensure successful mission and business outcomes. The space industry is adopting more software-based automation and emulation tools to keep up with this accelerating pace of innovation. But according to a recent Coleman Parkes Research survey commissioned by Keysight Technologies, 76% of space professionals still see software test automation as the top technical challenge facing the satellite industry. More than half of survey respondents (53%) cited system-level modeling and simulation as the next pressing technical challenge, followed by 46% who cited design validation, according to the survey report   Defying Gravity  . These findings highlight the need for advanced automation and emulation tools that can accelerate design and engineering processes. In top industry trends identified by respondents, 43% cited shortened product development times as the leading trend, followed by 37% who cited advanced payload systems and 34% who cited artificial intelligence (AI). Other key findings from the report include:   Satellites – When looking at the top 10 industry trends for the next three years, respondents mentioned satellites most frequently. The top trend they identified was small satellites in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), followed by very high throughput satellites, cybersecurity, in-orbit services, and large constellations in low earth orbit (LEO).  Data gathering, research, and communications applications – Respondents most frequently cited data gathering, research, and communications when identifying the applications that’ll most impact the space industry. The top application cited was big data gathering and analytics, followed by earth observation, global positioning/time services, science/research, and Internet/voice/broadcast services.  Costs and supply chain risks – Survey respondents cited costs and supply chain as the greatest risks to their projects. The top risk cited was unpredictability in costs, followed by part/subsystem supply, technical scope, and program funding.  Overcoming obstacles   5G-satellite-communications   Survey respondents identified software test automation as their top technical challenge due to the complexity of satellites, along with their nature as a system-of-systems that’s part of a larger system. All this makes testing and evaluation a critical aspect of ensuring mission success. Even low-cost satellites must be thoroughly validated on the ground before launch, from early design through manufacturing and operation. Plus, with the higher number of satellites being constructed, we’re transitioning away from a single satellite production model into a volume production situation where satellite factories are producing one or more satellites per day. This makes it impractical, if not impossible, to produce a satellite and verify its functionality manually. Human error, along with the need for consistency during multiple rounds of satellite system testing, make it critical to have strong process automation to eliminate possible defects. Other technical challenges remain. Designing for high reliability – while optimizing for power efficiency and longer than a five-year lifetime – can be extremely challenging and must be thoroughly tested before a mission. Another problem involves the use of radio frequency (RF) spectrum in communication satellites to ensure sufficient RF power and bandwidth, as well as steering RF signals to precisely where they’re needed. Low-cost phased array antennas are enabling improvements in this area. So are developments in free"

        "text": "For over 80 years, Canadian engineering and manufacturing has been a cornerstone of the global aerospace supply chain and the envy of other countries around the world. This was thanks to the innovative and collaborative efforts of industry, a longstanding commitment from government and political determination to ensure Canada remained a leading aerospace nation. \n“Canada maintains a distinct advantage as one of the only countries in the world capable of manufacturing an aircraft from nose to tail and certifying it.”\n Today, Canada’s aerospace sector stands as a major engine of our economy, generating $27 billion in GDP, with over 80% of manufacturing revenues stemming from exports in 2022 (approximately $18.7 billion to 196 countries).

As the global aerospace supply chain undergoes significant and transformative changes, propelled by disruptive, innovative, and world-class ideas that are shaping the trajectory of aerospace practises and technologies for decades to come, it is also poised for exponential growth. Recent forecasts indicate a 28% increase in the global fleet over the next 10 years from 28,400 aircraft to 36,400 by the year 2034. \n This projected demand for new aircraft, coupled with aging fleets around the world that require maintenance, repair and overhaul services (MRO), presents a tremendous opportunity for Canada to leverage our distinct advantage and reclaim our position as a global aerospace powerhouse. Ensuring we are positioned to capitalize on this projected demand over the next decade will be critical, not only in terms of fortifying Canada’s leadership in the global aerospace value chain but providing economic stability for Canadians at a time when our country needs it most.  \nThe Need for an Aerospace Strategy\n \n Canada’s aerospace industry can be our ticket to greater economic stability, though we need a strategy to better align policies, investments and opportunities for civil aviation, defence and space so that they benefit Canada, ultimately creating more jobs, modernizing our defence capabilities and strengthening our industrial base.  \n“The global space economy reached $469B in 2021, but Canada failed to rank within the top five among countries in the spacetech sector.”\n Take the global space industry. Canada’s contributions to satellite communications, Earth observation and robotics are substantial. However, according to the Space Foundation’s 2022 report, the global space economy reached $469B in 2021, but Canada failed to rank within the top five among countries in the spacetech sector. An industrial aerospace strategy would help Canada leverage our competitive advantage while aligning policies, investments and opportunities to unlock our potential for world-class ideas that lead to growth, innovation and technological advancements. This will help position our country as the leading aerospace nation of the 21st century.  \n“We will need more in R&amp;D to enable the adoption of more sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), enhancement of aircraft efficiency and implementation of operational changes to reduce emissions.”\n Canada’s aerospace industry is also committed to helping achieve our country’s environmental goals, including reaching net zero by 2050, as outlined in Canada’s Aviation Climate Action Plan. The targets laid out in Canada’s climate action plan are ambitious, and as industry continues working towards these objectives, we will need more in R&amp;D to enable the adoption of more sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), enhancement of aircraft efficiency and implementation of operational changes to reduce emissions. We cannot take this journey alone. We need leadership from the government to ensure our collective goals are met and that Canada is not left behind by other countries. \n Increased production and access to SAF, for example, will be critical. We need coordination throughout the supply chain, from feedstock suppliers to fuel producers, distributors and end users. Aligning various policies and investment opportunities through an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada would not only support our shared environmental goals but enable our country to play a leading role in the transition to more sustainable aerospace technology and practices. However, in the absence of a supportive regulatory environment and a clear commitment from the government to an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada, we are merely scratching the surface of our potential while allowing other countries to seize these opportunities in front of us and ensure the long-term viability of both their aerospace sector and national economy. \n In addition to its economic and environmental contributions, Canada’s aerospace sector plays a vital role in international peace and security. Defence-related revenues accounted for 17% of Canada’s total aerospace revenue in 2020, highlighting the industry’s significance in safeguarding our borders and national interests. Released in April 2024, Canada’s latest Defence Policy Update (DPU) is a positive step forward, acknowledging the pivotal role of aerospace in protecting our interests and asserting our sovereignty. Yet, to institutionalize and operationalize the goals and objectives outlined in the DPU, an industrial aerospace strategy is essential. This strategy would not only complement the DPU but also provide the clarity and predictability needed to fortify Canada’s aerospace defence capabilities, drive innovation, attract investments and generate high-value employment opportunities for Canadians. \nThe Future of Canada’s Aerospace Industry\n Considering the over 600 diverse aerospace companies spanning every corner of the country and the over 200,000 workers who rely on the industry to support their families, an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada is essential. It is our flight plan for growth and economic prosperity that will enable our world-class industry to enhance its competitiveness and solidify its position as a global leader in aerospace.  \n While uncertainty still looms as to the importance Canada places on its aerospace sector, the perception around Canada’s commitment to aerospace recently changed at the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada’s (AIAC) annual Aerospace on the Hill event. During the lobby event, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Francois-Philippe Champagne expressed his willingness to work with industry in crafting an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada. An aerospace strategy for Canada has also been endorsed by several key stakeholders over the years, including the House of Commons Standing Committee on Transport Infrastructure and Communities, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry and Technology and most recently, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. This signifies a crucial turning point, with the stakes for Canada having never been higher. \n As the voice of Canada’s aerospace industry, AIAC and our members stand united, ready to collaborate, innovate and do our part to pave the way for an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada that will propel our industry and the Canadian economy to new heights. \n“We need action and a clear commitment from the government on an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada. Otherwise, we will continue to undermine our progress and global competitiveness.”\n Building on the long-standing partnership between government and the aerospace industry in Canada, we have the capabilities, talent and expertise to take advantage of the opportunities on our radar. Now, we need action and a clear commitment from the government on an industrial aerospace strategy for Canada. Otherwise, we will continue to undermine our progress and global competitiveness while watching our place in the global aerospace ecosystem continue to erode.  \n  Stay tuned for the upcoming State of Canada’s Aerospace Industry report, releasing in July .

        "text": "Boeing announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Spirit AeroSystems early July 1 in an all-stock transaction at an equity value of $4.7 billion, or $37.25 per share. The total transaction value is $8.3 billion, including Spirit’s last reported net debt.  Boeing’s acquisition of Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit will include substantially all Boeing-related commercial operations, as well as additional commercial, defense and aftermarket operations, according to the announcement. As part of the transaction, Boeing will work with Spirit to ensure the continuity of operations supporting Spirit’s customers and programs it acquires, including working with the U.S. Defense Department and Spirit defense customers. Spirit also signed a binding term sheet with Airbus under which the European manufacturer will take on certain commercial work packages that Spirit performs for Airbus concurrently with the closing of the Boeing-Spirit merger. Airbus will take over certain Spirit operations for a nominal fee of $1 and $559 million in compensation from Spirit. The work packages include the production of A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina, and St. Nazaire, France; the A220’s wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco; and the A220 pylons in Wichita. In addition, Spirit plans to pursue the divestiture of operations in Subang, Malaysia, and Prestwick, Scotland, that support Airbus programs, as well as its non-Airbus work in Belfast, as that facility supports a number of other programs. Airbus said that entering into definitive agreements remains subject to an ensuing due diligence process. “While there is no guarantee that a transaction will be concluded, all parties are willing and interested to work in good faith to progress and complete this process as timely as possible,” Airbus said. Still, Boeing said the companies see the transaction closing mid-2025, subject to the sale of the Spirit operations related to Airbus commercial work packages and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and Spirit shareholder approvals. “We want to insource parts of Spirit against the backdrop of Spirit going back to Boeing,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told Aviation Week in an interview conducted before the deal was announced. “[Production of Airbus components] is something we don’t want to see in the hands of a competitor.” On vertical integration in general, Faury said that “we are verticalizing, but not as an overall strategy because I believe it would backfire with a huge complexity. But in this case, there is a big reward because it is a huge driver of performance, the ability to do the ramp-up, future products and control. You need to do what is really important and not do the rest.” A ‘Slightly Higher’ Price  Boeing’s proposed price of $37.25 per share represents a 30% premium to Spirit’s closing stock price of $28.60 on Feb. 29, 2024—the day before Spirit and Boeing issued press releases confirming they were in discussions regarding a potential transaction. “Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies’ manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,” said Patrick Shanahan, Spirit’s interim CEO and president. He continued, “We are proud of the part we have played in Airbus’ programs and believe bringing these programs under Airbus ownership will enable greater integration and alignment.” According to Spirit, the supplier’s board of directors unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement with Boeing and the term sheet with Airbus. “By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our Safety and Quality Management Systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes—centered on safety and quality,” Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said.  Boeing had initially said it would use debt and cash to buy Spirit, a move the companies confirmed they were discussing on March 1. But Boeing’s credit ratings with major agencies teeter on the brink of junk status. In subsequent months, Boeing executives voiced openness to using stock as currency instead. Much like terms and conditions, the valuation method for deals between Spirit and the rival airframers has been mysterious to outsiders such as Wall Street analysts and industry consultants. A Boeing takeover of Spirit—something Boeing leaders publicly disdained up to last year—was identified as a central corrective action for the embattled OEM, which has come under fire for manufacturing mishaps this year following the Jan. 5 door plug blowout on an inflight Boeing 737-9. “Although details are not yet clear, this price appears slightly higher than our expectations,” Bernstein Research analysts said June 30 after the announcements. Melius Research analysts in late March said Spirit could be worth around $9 billion, or close to $49 a share, compared with the $29 per share that Spirit traded at before news of the deal talks were first reported. But Boeing did not have to pay fair value for Spirit, they pointed out, as Spirit relies on Boeing for most of its revenue and Spirit also suffers cash-draining contracts, including for Airbus. “It just needs to pay an amount that Spirit’s shareholders would deem acceptable,” the analysts noted at the time. Analysts at Jefferies had guessed June 5 that a Boeing proposal could value Spirit around $38 a share, yet in a range of $28-40. Their valuation method assumed Boeing would not receive parts of Spirit that do work for Airbus.  Boeing will have to earn the trust of its new Wichita employees, said the senior U.S. senator from Missouri June 30 as it became apparent that an announcement was imminent. “There is no doubt that Boeing has a fractured history in Wichita,” Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said. “I have spoken to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and Chairman of the Board Steven Mollenkopf and conveyed that Boeing must earn the trust and respect of its Wichita employees and the community.” In a separate but related development, Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department will criminally charge Boeing with fraud over two fatal crashes and ask the company to plead guilty or face a trial. Federal prosecutors allege Boeing violated the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement after the 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.  ||||I||||Press Option+1 for screen-reader mode, Option+0 to cancel Accessibility Screen-Reader Guide, Feedback, and Issue Reporting\nhttps://aviationweek.com/themes/custom/particle/dist/app-drupal/assets/awn-logo.svg\nSkip to main content\n* Market Sector\n+ Aerospace\n+ Air Transport\n+ MRO\n+ Defense and Space\n+ Business Aviation\n* Markets\n+ Aerospace\no Aircraft & Propulsion\no Connected Aerospace\no Emerging Technologies\no Manufacturing & Supply Chain\no Advanced Air Mobility\no Commercial Space\no Sustainability\n+ Air Transport\no Aircraft & Propulsion\no Interiors & Connectivity\no Airports & Networks\no Airlines & Lessors\no Safety, Ops & Regulation\no Maintenance & Training\no Sustainability\n+ MRO\no Aircraft & Propulsion\no Interiors & Connectivity\no Emerging Technologies\no Supply Chain\no Safety, Ops & Regulation\no Workforce & Training\no Sustainability\n+ Defense and Space\no Aircraft & Propulsion\no Sensors & Electronic Warfare\no Missile Defense & Weapons\no Supply Chain\no Budget, Policy & Operations\no Space\no Sustainability\n+ Business Aviation\no Aircraft & Propulsion\no Interiors & Connectivity\no Airports, FBOs & Suppliers\no Flight Deck\no Safety, Ops & Regulation\no Maintenance & Training\no Sustainability\n* Marketplace\n* Services\n+ Services\no Advertising\no Marketing Services\no Fleet, Data & APIs\no Research & Consulting\no Network and Route Planning\no Marketplace\n* Store\n+ Market Sector\no Aerospace\no Air Transport\no MRO\no Defense and Space\no Business Aviation\n+ Type View All Products\no Intelligence Bundles\n- AWIN - Premium\n- AWIN - Aerospace and Defense\n- AWIN - Business Aviation\n- AWIN - Commercial Aviation\no Market Briefings\n- Advanced Air Mobility Report - NEW!\n- Aerospace Daily & Defense Report\n- Aviation Daily\n- SpeedNews\n- The Weekly of Business Aviation\no Directories\n- Air Charter Guide\n- Aviation Week Marketplace\n- Route Exchange\n- The Engine Yearbook\no Data Services\n- AC-U-KWIK\n- Aircraft Bluebook\n- Airportdata.com\n- Airport Strategy and Marketing (ASM)\n- CAPA – Centre for Aviation\n- Fleet Discovery Civil\n- Fleet Discovery Military\n- Fleet & MRO Forecast\n- MRO Prospector\no Publications\n- Air Transport World\n- Aviation Week & Space Technology\n- Aviation Week & Space Technology - Inside MRO\n- Business & Commercial Aviation\n- CAPA - Airline Leader\n- Routes magazine\n- ShowNews\no Resources\n- Downloadable Reports\n* Events\n+ Recent webinars\n+ Events View All Events\no MRO\n- MRO Americas\n- MRO Asia\n- MRO Australasia\n- MRO Baltics & Eastern Europe Region\n- MRO Europe\n- MRO Latin America\n- MRO Middle East\n- Military Aviation Logistics and Maintenance Symposium (MALMS)\n- Asia Aerospace Leadership Forum & MRO Asia-Pacific Awards\no Commercial Aviation/A&D\n- A&D Mergers and Acquisitions\n- A&D Programs\n- A&D Manufacturing\n- A&D Raw Materials\n- A&D SupplyChain\n- A&D SupplyChain Europe\n- Advanced Air Mobility\n- Aero-Engines Americas\n- Aero-Engines Europe\n- Aero-Engines Asia-Pacific\n- Digital Transformation Summit\n- Engine Leasing Trading & Finance Europe\n- Engine Leasing, Trading & Finance Americas\no Air Transport\n- Routes Americas\n- Routes Europe\n- Routes World\n- CAPA Airline Leader Summit - Airlines in Transition\n- CAPA Airline Leader Summit - Americas\n- CAPA Airline Leader Summit - Latin America & Caribbean\n- CAPA Airline Leader Summit - Australia Pacific\n- CAPA Airline Leader Summit - Asia & Sustainability Awards\n- CAPA Airline Leader Summit - World & Awards for Excellence\n- GAD Americas\n- GAD World\no Aerospace and Defense\n- A&D Mergers and Acquisitions Conference (ADMA)\n- A&D Manufacturing Conference\n- Aerospace Raw Materials & Manufacturers Supply Chain Conference (RMC)\n- A&D Programs\no Awards\n- Aviation Week 20 Twenties\n- Aviation Week Laureate Awards\n- ATW Airline Awards\n- Program Excellence Awards and Banquet\n- CAPA Asia Aviation Summit & Awards for Excellence\n* About\n+ About Aviation Week Network\no Our Story\no Content and Data Team\no Aviation Week & Space Technology 100-Year\n+ Contact Us\no Subscriber Services\no Advertising, Marketing Services & List Rentals\no Content Sales\no Events\no PR & Communications\no Content Licensing and Reprints\no FAQ\n* Log In\n* Register\n* My Account\n+ Profile\n+ Sign Out\n* AWIN Access\n* My cart\n*\nBack to\n1.

As part of the transaction, Boeing will work with Spirit to ensure the continuity of operations supporting Spirit’s customers and programs it acquires, including working with the U.S. Defense Department and Spirit defense customers.\nSpirit also signed a binding term sheet with Airbus under which the European manufacturer will take on certain commercial work packages that Spirit performs for Airbus concurrently with the closing of the Boeing-Spirit merger.\nAirbus will take over certain Spirit operations for a nominal fee of $1 and $559 million in compensation from Spirit. The work packages include the production of A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina, and St. Nazaire, France; the A220’s wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Casablanca, Morocco; and the A220 pylons in Wichita. In addition, Spirit plans to pursue the divestiture of operations in Subang, Malaysia, and Prestwick, Scotland, that support Airbus programs, as well as its non-Airbus work in Belfast, as that facility supports a number of other programs.\nAirbus said that entering into definitive agreements remains subject to an ensuing due diligence process. “While there is no guarantee that a transaction will be concluded, all parties are willing and interested to work in good faith to progress and complete this process as timely as possible,” Airbus said.\nStill, Boeing said the companies see the transaction closing mid-2025, subject to the sale of the Spirit operations related to Airbus commercial work packages and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and Spirit shareholder approvals.\n“We want to insource parts of Spirit against the backdrop of Spirit going back to Boeing,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told Aviation Week in an interview conducted before the deal was announced. “[Production of Airbus components] is something we don’t want to see in the hands of a competitor.”\nOn vertical integration in general, Faury said that “we are verticalizing, but not as an overall strategy because I believe it would backfire with a huge complexity. But in this case, there is a big reward because it is a huge driver of performance, the ability to do the ramp-up, future products and control. You need to do what is really important and not do the rest.”\nA ‘Slightly Higher’ Price\nBoeing’s proposed price of $37.25 per share represents a 30% premium to Spirit’s closing stock price of $28.60 on Feb. 29, 2024—the day before Spirit and Boeing issued press releases confirming they were in discussions regarding a potential transaction.\n“Bringing Spirit and Boeing together will enable greater integration of both companies’ manufacturing and engineering capabilities, including safety and quality systems,” said Patrick Shanahan, Spirit’s interim CEO and president. He continued, “We are proud of the part we have played in Airbus’ programs and believe bringing these programs under Airbus ownership will enable greater integration and alignment.”\nAccording to Spirit, the supplier’s board of directors unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement with Boeing and the term sheet with Airbus.\n“By reintegrating Spirit, we can fully align our commercial production systems, including our Safety and Quality Management Systems, and our workforce to the same priorities, incentives and outcomes—centered on safety and quality,” Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said.\nBoeing had initially said it would use debt and cash to buy Spirit, a move the companies confirmed they were discussing on March 1. But Boeing’s credit ratings with major agencies teeter on the brink of junk status. In subsequent months, Boeing executives voiced openness to using stock as currency instead.\nMuch like terms and conditions, the valuation method for deals between Spirit and the rival airframers has been mysterious to outsiders such as Wall Street analysts and industry consultants. A Boeing takeover of Spirit—something Boeing leaders publicly disdained up to last year—was identified as a central corrective action for the embattled OEM, which has come under fire for manufacturing mishaps this year following the Jan. 5 door plug blowout on an inflight Boeing 737-9.\n“Although details are not yet clear, this price appears slightly higher than our expectations,” Bernstein Research analysts said June 30 after the announcements.\nMelius Research analysts in late March said Spirit could be worth around $9 billion, or close to $49 a share, compared with the $29 per share that Spirit traded at before news of the deal talks were first reported. But Boeing did not have to pay fair value for Spirit, they pointed out, as Spirit relies on Boeing for most of its revenue and Spirit also suffers cash-draining contracts, including for Airbus. “It just needs to pay an amount that Spirit’s shareholders would deem acceptable,” the analysts noted at the time.\nAnalysts at Jefferies had guessed June 5 that a Boeing proposal could value Spirit around $38 a share, yet in a range of $28-40.

        "text": "Associated Press  \nAirbus and Boeing divested of their aerostructures businesses in the early 2000s, along with other divisions that were not considered core to their strategy of becoming aircraft integrators. Airbus recently reversed this move, as it now considers aerostructures as a core airplane design and manufacturing activity. It will re-integrate its two major aerostructures assembly companies, calling it Airbus Atlantic.\nThe industry dynamics have changed. While the OEMs were downsizing this past decade, select tier 1 suppliers were growing. The divestitures by the OEMs provided a growth opportunity for these smaller companies, dramatically transforming the aerospace and defense industry. RTX is the prime example of this growth. In the last 10 years, it became the largest tier 1 aerospace company, growing significantly through mergers and acquisitions.\nRTX, formerly known as United Technologies Corporation, grew by acquiring Goodrich in 2012, B/E Aerospace in 2017 and Rockwell Collins in 2018 and then merging with Raytheon in 2020. RTX today is comprised of three business units: Collins Aerospace, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Raytheon. For some perspective, RTX annual revenues were $67 billion in 2022, compared with Boeing’s $66.6 billion during that same period.\nThe trend of tier-1 growth is not new, but such large-scale growth was initially limited to primarily RTX. The newer trend is that there are more tier 1s following the growth trend that RTX started through mergers and acquisitions.\nOliver Althoff, managing director for Aviation, Aerospace and Defense at Seabury Capital Group, recently shared with me that several tier-1 aerospace and defense companies continue to reshape their portfolios with respect to changing strategic orientation. These companies, he said, may be seeking to increase margins, or they only have a certain amount of cash earmarked for capital expenditures, networking capital investments or research and development expenditures for new programs. The internal cash requests of businesses often exceed what the corporate parent can invest, creating haves and have-nots among different business units.\nAlthoff also noted that these publicly traded companies return cash to shareholders through share buybacks or dividends as a regularly planned use of cashflow that is generated. In those instances, business units are either struggling to achieve their business metrics or margin targets or are left void of investments. Althoff summarized his thoughts that often companies divest portions of the business to a new owner for whom such a business unit might be a better fit.\nBall Corporation announced on August 17 its divestiture of its aerospace business, Ball Aerospace, to BAE Systems for $5.5 billion.

        "text": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the President's Fiscal Year 2025 Defense Budget \n\"The President's budget request for the Department of Defense is once again rooted in our 2022 National Defense Strategy, which continues to enable us to match our national resources to our national objectives. This request will bolster our ability to defend our country, paced to the challenge posed by an increasingly aggressive People's Republic of China. It will better posture us to deter aggression against the United States, or our allies and partners, while also preparing us to prevail in conflict if necessary. It will continue to forge a more resilient joint force and a modern defense ecosystem, built for the security challenges of the 21st century. And it will strengthen the unmatched global network of alliances and partnerships that magnifies our power and deepens our security.\nThis budget request is consistent with the funding levels approved by Congress under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. Under these caps, we made difficult but responsible decisions focusing on maintaining our military's readiness and taking care of our personnel. So our budget request reflects targeted reductions to programs delivering key capabilities in later years to support the joint force's ability to fight and win in the near term.\nWe must continue to invest in cutting-edge defense capabilities and to advance new operational concepts across domains, from advanced cyber systems and enhanced space capabilities to a modernized nuclear triad. This budget request also reflects a deep commitment to our people, who will always be the Department's greatest strategic asset; we hope to raise basic pay, boost quality-of-life initiatives, and promote safety and accountability.\nMoreover, this request will enable the Department to deepen cooperation with our interagency colleagues, industry, academia, allies, and partners. Through cooperative defense initiatives, multilateral joint exercises, and shared technology development, we will enhance our capabilities and help make America and the world more secure.\nSince my first day as Secretary of Defense, I have focused on three priorities: defending the Nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork. President Biden's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request advances each of these priorities.\nAs Congress writes authorizing and appropriations legislation in the months ahead, I am grateful for Members' support for the budget and the mission of the Department of Defense.\"\n The President's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request for the Department of Defense \nOn March 11, 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration submitted to Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request of $849.8 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD), consistent with the caps approved by Congress under the Financial Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023. The FY 2025 defense budget request provides the capabilities and investments to advance the Secretary's three key priorities: defending the United States, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork. \nTo achieve these priorities, this budget request links our strategic goals to our resources to continue executing our 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which aligns with the President's National Security Strategy. These guiding documents determine the direction of the Department of Defense in what the President has called the \"decisive decade.\" The NDS outlines the Department's defense and security priorities:\nDefending the homeland, paced to the growing, multi-domain challenge posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC);\nDeterring strategic attacks against the United States, our allies, and our partners; \nMeeting the acute threat of a newly aggressive Russia;\nTackling the dangers from Iran, North Korea, global terrorist groups, and more;\nBuilding a resilient joint force and defense ecosystem.\nThe NDS positions the U.S. military to meet our defense challenges through integrated deterrence, campaigning, and actions to build enduring advantages. The FY 2025 DoD budget request of $849.8 billion enables the Department to advance these goals by providing the resources to position our warfighters, allies, and partners for success. This budget continues to make the investments necessary to execute the NDS, but the FRA topline limitations required the Department to make tough but responsible choices. We made targeted reductions to programs that will not deliver capability to the force until the 2030s to preserve and enhance the Total Force's ability to fight and win in the near term.\n Integrated Deterrence \nThe FY 2025 budget request allows the DoD to invest in capabilities to maintain a ready, lethal, and combat-credible joint force, with a laser focus on the pacing challenge from the PRC, as well as the acute threat posed by Putin's Russia. The budget makes critical investments to revitalize the defense industrial base, drive innovation, and take care of the Department's personnel. The FY 2025 budget request includes $143.2 billion in research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E), and would also fund $167.5 billion for procurement. Combined, these investments will establish even stronger, nimbler, and more modern combat-credible forces across all domains. \nInvestments in platforms and systems across the air, sea, and land domains will increase the lethality of our Joint Force and enhance our ability to deter threats well into the future. So this budget request includes:\n$61.2 billion for airpower to continue developing, modernizing, and procuring lethal air forces; \n$48.1 billion for sea power, including new construction of six battle force fleet ships; and\n$13.0 billion for land power, supporting the modernization of Army and Marine Corps combat equipment.\nA safe, secure, effective, and credible nuclear deterrent remains the ultimate check on strategic attacks on our country and our allies. To sustain this level of deterrence, the FY 2025 budget requests $49.2 billion to modernize and recapitalize all three legs of the nuclear triad and operate our legacy systems even as we pursue arms control measures that enhance U.S. and allied security. For example, the budget requests:\n$9.9 billion for the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine; \n$5.3 billion to continue development and procurement of the B-21 strategic bomber program; and\n$3.7 billion to continue funding for the ground-based Sentinel program. \nOur highest defense priority remains to deter attack against the United States. The PRC and Russia are fielding conventional long-range and hypersonic weapons that can threaten our allies, partners, and U.S. forces. Therefore, the FY 2025 budget requests $28.4 billion to enhance U.S. missile-defense capabilities to defend the homeland, U.S. deployed forces, and our allies and partners against this growing missile threat. \nOther critical investment highlights include:\n$9.8 billion in long-range fires to hold adversary targets at risk from operationally relevant ranges and reduce risks to U.S. forces and assets;\n$33.7 billion for vital space capabilities, resilient architectures, and enhanced space command and control to keep space safe for military, civilian, and commercial operations; and\n$14.5 billion for cyberspace activities focused on three main portfolios covering cybersecurity, cyberspace operations, and cyber research and development.\n Campaigning \nThe second way we advance the NDS is through campaigning, or well-planned and carefully sequenced exercises and initiatives to advance our defense priorities. Campaigning starts with our strategic readiness and our ability to build, maintain, and balance warfighting forces, capabilities, and competitive advantages to achieve our strategic objectives. The Department's FY 2025 budget request therefore prioritizes the readiness of our joint force, investing $147.5 billion to build and maintain our warfighting forces and capabilities. The budget request is designed to maintain our current levels of readiness while modernizing to meet future challenges. The Department's strategic-readiness framework keeps our eyes on the horizon, carefully balancing today's urgent and competing demands with preparing to prevail in long-term strategic competition.\nThe FY 2025 budget request includes critical investments to strengthen deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including ballistic missile-defense activities in support of Guam; expanded security cooperation with our valued allies and partners; increased investments in exercises, training, and experimentation activities; cyber operations technology support; the fielding of uncrewed and autonomous systems that can operate in all domains; and other innovative technologies.\nThe outcome of Putin's cruel and unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine will define global security for decades to come, and we remain determined to meet the moment. The FY 2025 budget request also funds our bedrock commitment to NATO, the indispensable defensive alliance that remains the foundation of transatlantic security, and includes $4.2 billion to support investments, activities, and operations within Europe to deter Russian aggression against our allies and partners, including:\n$9.9 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative;\n$2.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative;\n$625.6 million in NATO Military Contribution;\n$434 million for the NATO Security Investment Program; and\n$300 million to fund the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.\n Building Enduring Advantages \nThe Department's people – the Total Force – are its most valuable asset and we have made significant investments to take care of our people. In particular. DoD supports its outstanding all-volunteer force and their families by continuously working to strengthen economic security and improve quality of life. Critical investments in our people include:\nA 4.5 percent pay increase for Service members and annual rate increases for both housing and subsistence allowances;\n$245.3 million for a proposed substantial increase to the Income Eligibility Threshold for Basic Needs Allowance, an allowance designed to provide extra support to Service members and families who qualify;\nMore than $120 million in additional funding for commissaries to provide our Service members with food savings of over 25 percent compared to the local marketplace; \n$2.0 billion to support family housing to provide safe, high-quality residences for Service members and their families;\n$1.1 billion in unaccompanied housing or barracks construction;\n$547 million to prevent suicide in the military, including $261 million to implement the approved recommendations from the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee; and\n$1.2 billion to prevent sexual assault and other harmful behaviors, including $651 million for the continued implementation of the recommendations by the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military and funding for the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Education and Training Center of Excellence.\nAnother Department priority is investing in our technological advantage to maintain global readiness for decades to come. The Department's approach, which was codified in the National Defense Science and Technology Strategy, prioritizes three strategic lines of effort: focus on the Joint Mission; create and field capabilities at speed and scale; and strengthen the foundations of research and development. The FY 2025 budget request of $143.2 billion in Research, Development, Test &amp;Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), enables us to maintain our commitment to innovation and modernization with investments including:\n$17.2 billion in science and technology;\n$1.8 billion in artificial intelligence; \n$1.4 billion in Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control to deliver information advantage at the speed of relevance across all domains and partners;\n$450 million for the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve to help more swiftly field new capabilities;\n$144 million to support the Office of Strategic Capital, including $132.6 million in RDT&amp;E funding, which Secretary Austin established to enable the Department to attract and scale private capital in our most critical component-level supply chain technologies; and\nResources for the Department-wide Replicator Initiative to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to warfighters at speed and scale.\nIn addition, the Department is focused on manufacturing and production challenges, with continued investment in capabilities supporting a modern, technology-enabled industrial base. We also seek to make supply chains more resilient.\nThe recently released National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS) outlines four priorities for achieving a 21st-century defense industrial base: resilient supply chains, workforce readiness, flexible acquisition, and economic deterrence. Aligning our ongoing industrial-base efforts with the NDIS priorities will enable better coordination among programs and help us more swiftly identify opportunities for investments or policy modifications. The Department will continue to leverage authorities provided by Congress to deliver critical munitions affordably, while bolstering our inventories and providing a more predictable demand signal to industry. The FY 2025 budget request includes:\n$29.8 billion for munitions, including both conventional ammunition and Precision Guided Munitions;\n$4.0 billion in investments in the submarine industrial base, a historic investment in supplier and workforce development as well as infrastructure expansion and technological advances; and\n$2.5 billion for microelectronics to reduce gaps in the advanced packaging ecosystem.\nThe FY 2025 budget continues to build on prior investments by including $19.8 billion to sustain, restore, and modernize our facilities, as well as $17.5 billion in construction and family housing programs. These efforts support our people, enhance our deterrence, and improve our critical infrastructure. Those investments include:\n$8.7 billion in facilities supporting readiness improvements;\n$2.5 billion in projects advancing the European Deterrence Initiative, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, and the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program;\n$2.0 billion in critical naval-infrastructure improvements; \n$2.3 billion to support the construction of other new quality-of-life facilities including barracks, dormitories, child development centers and youth centers, medical clinics, and schools. \nAs always, the Department is committed to being a responsible steward of hard-earned taxpayer funds — and committed to better performance across the defense enterprise. The FY 2025 Defense Budget includes $1.3 billion in support of the DoD audit. This includes funding for audit services, support, remediation and financial systems. The Department has taken significant steps to improve our systems, modernize our enterprise, and attract and retain the best possible talent. We must continue to align our resources with our evolving defense needs. That will ensure that we can secure the right capabilities to build enduring advantages over our global competitors — and work toward a safer America in a more stable, open, and prosperous world.\nThe FY 2025 Defense Budget positions the Department to support its people and its allies and partners during this decisive decade — and to meet the defense challenges that our republic faces today and will face far into the future.\nThe entire budget proposal and additional materials are available at: https://comptroller.defense.gov/Budget-Materials/Budget2025/ \n ||||I|||| Skip to main content (Press Enter).\nAn official website of the United States Government\nHere's how you know\nOfficial websites use .gov\nA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS\nA lock ( ) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website.

Austin III on the President's Fiscal Year 2025 Defense Budget\n\"The President's budget request for the Department of Defense is once again rooted in our 2022 National Defense Strategy, which continues to enable us to match our national resources to our national objectives. This request will bolster our ability to defend our country, paced to the challenge posed by an increasingly aggressive People's Republic of China. It will better posture us to deter aggression against the United States, or our allies and partners, while also preparing us to prevail in conflict if necessary. It will continue to forge a more resilient joint force and a modern defense ecosystem, built for the security challenges of the 21st century. And it will strengthen the unmatched global network of alliances and partnerships that magnifies our power and deepens our security.\nThis budget request is consistent with the funding levels approved by Congress under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. Under these caps, we made difficult but responsible decisions focusing on maintaining our military's readiness and taking care of our personnel. So our budget request reflects targeted reductions to programs delivering key capabilities in later years to support the joint force's ability to fight and win in the near term.\nWe must continue to invest in cutting-edge defense capabilities and to advance new operational concepts across domains, from advanced cyber systems and enhanced space capabilities to a modernized nuclear triad. This budget request also reflects a deep commitment to our people, who will always be the Department's greatest strategic asset; we hope to raise basic pay, boost quality-of-life initiatives, and promote safety and accountability.\nMoreover, this request will enable the Department to deepen cooperation with our interagency colleagues, industry, academia, allies, and partners. Through cooperative defense initiatives, multilateral joint exercises, and shared technology development, we will enhance our capabilities and help make America and the world more secure.\nSince my first day as Secretary of Defense, I have focused on three priorities: defending the Nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork. President Biden's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request advances each of these priorities.\nAs Congress writes authorizing and appropriations legislation in the months ahead, I am grateful for Members' support for the budget and the mission of the Department of Defense.\"\nThe President's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Request for the Department of Defense\nOn March 11, 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration submitted to Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request of $849.8 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD), consistent with the caps approved by Congress under the Financial Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023.
