(Video: Alexa Juliana Ard, Neeti Upadhye, Brian Monroe/The Washington Post/The Examination)      As the World Health Organization raised questions this summer about the risks of a popular artificial sweetener, a new hashtag began spreading on the social media accounts of health professionals: #safetyofaspartame. Steph Grasso, a registered dietitian from Oakton, Va., used the hashtag and told her 2.2 million followers on TikTok that the WHO warnings about artificial sweeteners were “clickbait” based on “low-quality science.”  Another dietitian, Cara Harbstreet of Kansas City, reassured her Instagram followers not to worry about “fear mongering headlines” about aspartame because “the evidence doesn’t suggest there’s a reason for concern.” In a third video, Mary Ellen Phipps, a Houston-area dietitian who specializes in diabetes care, sipped from a glass of soda and told her Instagram viewers that artificial sweeteners “satisfy the desire for sweetness” without affecting blood sugar or insulin levels. What these dietitians didn’t make clear was that they were paid to post the videos by American Beverage, a trade and lobbying group representing Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other companies. In all, at least 35 posts from a dozen health professionals were part of the coordinated campaign by American Beverage. The trade group paid an undisclosed amount to 10 registered dietitians, as well as a physician and a fitness influencer, to use their social media accounts to help blunt the WHO’s claims that aspartame, a mainstay of Diet Coke and other sodas, is ineffective for weight loss and “possibly carcinogenic.”  The campaign, which the beverage group acknowledged organizing, highlighted a little-known tactic the multibillion-dollar food and beverage industry is using to sway consumers faced with often-contradictory health messages about popular products. The food, beverage and dietary supplement industries are paying dozens of registered dietitians that collectively have millions of social media followers to help sell products and deliver industry-friendly messages on Instagram and TikTok, according to an analysis by The Washington Post and The Examination, a new nonprofit newsroom specializing in global public health reporting. The analysis of thousands of posts found that companies and industry groups paid dietitians for content that encouraged viewers to eat candy and ice cream, downplayed the health risks of highly processed foods and pushed unproven supplements — messages that run counter to decades of scientific evidence about healthy eating. The review found that among 68 dietitians with 10,000 or more social media followers on TikTok or Instagram, about half had promoted food, beverages or supplements to their combined 11 million followers within the last year. While some dietitians noted in their social media posts that they were part of paid partnerships, their relationships with the food industry were in many cases not made explicit to viewers, the analysis found. The Federal Trade Commission advises all social media influencers to be clear about who is paying them for promotions. The strategy of enlisting dietitians on social media has allowed the industry to extend its vast reach and promote often-questionable nutrition advice to new generations of teenage and Gen Z eaters and millennial parents accustomed to finding news and health advice on social media. By paying registered dietitians — health professionals who specialize in nutrition — the food industry is moving beyond the world of ordinary online influencers to harness the prestige of credentialed experts to deliver commercial messages. “They’re getting these dietitians to essentially do their marketing for them,” said Marlene Schwartz, the director of the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health. American Beverage said the dietitians who participated in its campaign adequately disclosed their relationships to the trade association by flagging the posts as paid partnerships or listing the #safetyofaspartame hashtag or the safetyofaspartame.com website, which includes the American Beverage logo at the bottom of the page. Out of 35 videos, 11 specifically named the association or “AmeriBev” as the partner at the time the videos were first posted, according to the beverage group. A spokesman said the campaign was warranted because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other health authorities have said aspartame is safe and disagreed with the WHO’s warnings.  “The registered dietitians and nutritionists we relied on shared their own informed opinions when communicating the facts to their audiences, and were up front about being paid,” said William Dermody, an American Beverage spokesman.  Grasso declined to comment. Harbstreet and Phipps didn’t respond to phone calls, emails and a letter. After inquiries from The Post and The Examination, Harbstreet’s Instagram posts were changed to include “Paid Partnership with AmeriBev.” In comments on several of the posts, viewers expressed confusion about who sponsored the videos and whether the dietitians were being paid to defend aspartame. In the video that Phipps posted on her Instagram account “milknhoneynutrition,” she included the phrases “Paid partnership,” #ad and #safetyofaspartame . When a viewer posted a comment on the video asking Phipps who her “paid partner” was, Phipps acknowledged it was American Beverage and said any suggestion that \"I would compromise my professional ethics for money is insulting.” Another commenter replied, “You’re insulted, but I’m disillusioned.”    Encouraging followers to eat sugar and candy   Most of the 78,000 dietitians and nutritionists in the United States aren’t social media influencers. Many work in hospitals, departments of health, and private practices, and their median annual salary is $66,450, according to 2022 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the dietitian influencers contacted for this article wouldn’t say how much they are paid for sponsored posts, several said that companies generally pay a few thousand dollars per video and that offers could be as high as tens of thousands of dollars for creators with the biggest social media audiences. Registered dietitian Lindsay Pleskot, of Vancouver, British Columbia, has posted videos of herself eating ice cream and peanut butter cups while telling people that denying themselves sugary food will only make cravings worse. These and other posts were paid for by the Canadian Sugar Institute. The trade group, which is funded by sugar producers, includes the videos on its Instagram page.  In one video, Pleskot held a glazed doughnut and chocolate chip cookie, and she mocked advice to reduce sugar intake. She said the “best” ways to cut sugar are “with a knife, with my hands, even with my teeth.” In the description next to the video, she wrote, “dietitian approved.” Later in the post, it said “(AD),” to indicate it was a paid advertisement. After inquiries about the partnership, the posts were updated with “CdnSugarNutr,” which is the Instagram account for the Canadian Sugar Institute. In an email, Pleskot said that she “initially” had concerns about working with the sugar group, but that she has full control over her posts, which reflect her belief in “removing guilt and shame around food.” She wrote that “all collaborative content has been the same messaging I have shared organically for years.” “My integrity is most important to me,” she said. Another dietitian with a large social media following, Jenn Messina of North Vancouver, posted a video on Instagram where she added a lollipop to a dinner plate. She told parents the strategy will “prevent sweets obsession” and help kids develop healthier relationships with food. In another Instagram video, she told parents they can make Halloween less stressful by allowing kids to eat as much candy as they want when they’re done trick-or-treating. “This helps decrease the stash and makes it less of a ‘big deal,’” she wrote in the text alongside the video. “Yes, they may barf. That’s a great life lesson.” Messina also was paid by the Canadian Sugar Institute, which she disclosed on her posts and in an interview. Messina said that, while her advice is “nontraditional,” her goal is to help parents. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that too much added sugar can contribute to obesity, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Messina declined to say how much the sugar institute pays her for sponsored videos. She said she pitches ideas for videos to the institute but has “full say” on what she posts. “I don’t work with any industries that tell me what to say or how to say it — it has to be 100 percent my voice, or I won’t do it,” she said. Since last year, the sugar group has paid at least a dozen registered dietitians to post videos about sugar on Instagram. “If your kiddo is obsessed with sweets they likely need MORE access to sweets rather than LESS,” Messina wrote in one sponsored Instagram post. The Canadian Sugar Institute said that dietitians often come to the group for help expanding their reach and that the institute does not tell them what to say. “As with any dietitian activity, social media posts are based on each dietitian’s authentic interests, experience and independent evaluation of the evidence,” said Chiara DiAngelo, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition communications for the sugar institute, in an email. The analysis by The Post and The Examination also found that dietitians have been paid to tout the benefits of dietary supplements that lack scientific consensus, including products like collagen supplements promoted for skin, nail and joint health; detox teas that claim to help the body expel toxins; and capsules marketed for “mitochondrial health.” Cinthia Scott, an Augusta, Ga.-area dietitian who has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram, encourages parents to give what she calls “brain boosting” omega-3 fatty acid supplements to children as young as 6 months old. In the text adjacent to her post, Scott wrote, “Paid partnership with carlsonlabs.” Carlson Labs is an Illinois-based supplement company. The American Academy of Pediatrics warns that such supplements are not approved by the FDA. “Their contents may not match what is listed on the label,” the academy says. “Adverse events are not always reported either.” Schwartz, the University of Connecticut nutrition expert, said she found it “particularly egregious” that a dietitian would try to convince parents to give their children unproven supplements. “It’s just so incredibly unfair to parents who are trying to get clear information,” she said. Carlson said the dietitians it sponsors make their own assessments before giving endorsements. “Carlson is committed to partnering with knowledgeable and respected professionals in relevant fields who use their expertise ethically and transparently,” the company said in a statement. Scott did not respond to emails, phone calls and a letter.   Lack of clear disclosure ‘bad for consumers’   Regulators have struggled to keep up with the rapid rise of the online influence industry, experts say. The Federal Trade Commission instructs influencers who are paid to create sponsored messages to say clearly in both their videos and in the text of their posts that they have a financial relationship with the brand they’re promoting. Few of the dietitians in the analysis said in their actual videos that their posts were advertisements. Instead, in the text accompanying their videos, they used terms like #ad, #sponsored or “Paid partnership.” Michael Ostheimer, an attorney for the FTC’s division of advertising practices, said a key test is whether the sponsorship would surprise consumers and affect their opinion of the message’s credibility — what the agency refers to as an “unexpected material connection.” Of the 33 dietitians who posted paid content to their millions of followers, about half (17) did not clearly disclose their sponsorships in at least one of their posts. Another two placed disclosures deep in the descriptions. American Beverage’s campaign with dietitians is a case that would require clear disclosure, according to Bonnie Patten, executive director of Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit group that combats deceptive marketing. “Would you expect that a dietitian would be partnering with the soda industry?” Patten asked. “Those are the most important kinds of disclosures that we need.” In 2020 the FTC sent 10 warning letters to influencers, including rapper Cardi B, for not disclosing paid social media ads for a tea marketer. The tea company agreed to pay $1 million to settle charges that it misled consumers and didn’t adequately disclose payments to social media influencers. But aside from periodic sweeps against deceptive conduct, the commission does not have the resources to comprehensively enforce behavior within a continuously expanding online marketplace, said David Vladeck, former head of the commission’s bureau of consumer protection and now a Georgetown University law professor.  “When you don’t have sufficient enforcement, companies think they can get away with it,” Vladeck said. “No one on either side of the table thinks the FTC has the resources to really police this marketplace. And that’s bad for consumers.” The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the trade group that oversees registered dietitians, has a code of ethics that says that dietitians should disclose conflicts of interest and avoid “accepting gifts or services which potentially influence or which may give the appearance of influencing professional judgment.” Lauri Wright, the academy’s president, said the group educates its members “so that dietitians know what that line is and how not to cross that line.” The academy has a board of ethics that reviews allegations that dietitians have violated its ethical code and can impose penalties, including revoking a dietitian’s license, if it finds that a violation took place. So far, the board has not received any complaints about social media activities, Wright said.  Close ties between the food industry and dietitians  The food and beverage industry has for years nurtured a close relationship with the academy, which has accepted millions of dollars in donations from leading producers of soda, candy and ultra-processed foods, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestlé. The academy has allowed these companies to provide continuing education courses to its dietitians and has invested in food industry stocks. Two of the academy’s sponsors are American Beverage and Tate &amp; Lyle, one of the world’s largest producers of high-fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners. Some dietitians have questioned the relationship between the academy and food and beverage companies. In response to a 2013 report that investigated the academy’s industry ties, more than a dozen registered dietitians formed Dietitians for Professional Integrity, a group that advocated against what members saw as compromising financial ties to the food industry. Although the group raised these concerns from dietitians directly with the academy — an early petition garnered over 24,000 signatures — the group disbanded in 2018. “Fundamentally, I think it really fell on deaf ears throughout the time that we were advocating for this cause with the academy,” said one of the group’s co-founders, Elizabeth Lee, a registered dietitian and health educator at Stanford Medicine. Wright, the president of the nutrition academy, said in an email that its leaders “communicated often” with Dietitians for Professional Integrity when the group was still active, and that the academy has a “stringent process for reviewing, approving and rejecting potential corporate sponsors.” She said that sponsorships represent less than seven percent of the academy’s revenue, and that “sponsors do not influence the academy’s positions.” In the vetting system for sponsors, the academy looks “at the mix of products\" a company sells, Wright said. The beverage industry “sells so much more than just soda.”  Paid partnerships with food brands and industry groups  Dietitians who boast large social media followings said that brands are eager to recruit them, flooding them with offers to pitch products. Among the most popular is Grasso, with a combined following of 2.4 million on TikTok and Instagram. In her videos, she dances and lip syncs to pop music while preparing recipes or dresses in different outfits, such as red for blood sugar or blue for insulin, to explain nutrition concepts. Her goal, Grasso writes on her website, is to use her “expertise and comedy to provide evidence-based nutrition advice and debunk trending nutrition myths.” Grasso has parlayed her popularity into endorsement deals with numerous food and dietary supplement companies.     @stephgrassodietitian Collagen offers benefits that extend far beyond just supporting hair, skin and nails.

In these ads, Grasso flagged the posts as paid partnerships and tagged the brands in her captions. Shana Minei Spence, a dietitian with more than 265,000 followers on Instagram, eats pizza, french fries and ice cream in her social media videos to illustrate that no foods should be stigmatized. Spence, who works for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, describes herself as “pro-processed foods.” Spence said she partners with companies that share her values and turns down about 90 percent of sponsorship offers she receives. “I work in marginalized and food insecure neighborhoods, which is why I am passionate about de-stigmatizing processed foods,” she wrote in an email. Spence said she has been paid by the Japanese multinational food company Ajinomoto for a video debunking concerns about the flavor enhancer MSG. Spence didn’t say in the video that the message was sponsored. The caption says #AjiPartner. A spokesperson for Ajinomoto said that dietitians were essential to its campaign because of their “ability to communicate science credibly.” Spence has also posted on TikTok for a Dave’s Killer Bread snack bar. “Just keep them at your desk,” she said. In  the caption she wrote #ad, the brand name and tagged the post as a “Paid partnership.” Dave’s Killer Bread did not respond to questions. In April 2022, PepsiCo paid Spence to teach a webinar to other dietitians titled “Unpacking Preconceptions About Packaged Foods,” she said. Registered dietitians who participated received continuing education credits. In the webinar, Spence disputed health concerns about processed foods. “What we have to do as dietitians, as health professionals, is really debunk some of this information,” she told her listeners. In an interview, Spence said PepsiCo had no role in shaping her presentation. She declined to say how much the company paid her for the event. PepsiCo didn’t respond to a request for comment. Monica D’Agostino, a New York dietitian with more than 740,000 followers on TikTok, said in one video that she gets a barrage of offers to pitch “greens powders,” dietary supplements that are widely promoted with unproven claims and haven’t been well studied. In her video, D’Agostino said she would never “blindly promote” the powders because the blends of ingredients aren’t always clear. She jokingly lamented her professional ethics, “because there is a check behind those powders.” D’Agostino, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, said in the video that if she took the money she was offered to promote the supplements, she could afford to buy eight $1,450 designer Saint Laurent handbags and give $549 Apple AirPods Maxes to 20 of her friends. “I could be like Oprah with my friends: One for you, one for you, one for you,” D’Agostino said. “This is just me showing you — there is money behind those greens powders that are being marketed to you.”   About this story    This report is a joint investigation by The Washington Post and The Examination, a new nonprofit newsroom specializing in global public health reporting.

Data fact-checking by Hayden Godfrey from the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University.    Methodology    The Post and The Examination’s analysis included registered dietitians on Instagram and TikTok who used “Registered Dietitian,” “RD” or “RDN” in their account name or social media bio as of July 2023 (social media users can adjust these fields at any time). The analysis included only those who had at least 10,000 followers (the lower threshold for what is typically considered a “micro-influencer”), had created at least 10 posts over the last year, and had posted English-language content.   This identified 68 influencers. Reporters archived all posts between July 1, 2022, and Aug. 1, 2023, generating a database of over 6,000 pieces of content.   Two reporters separately reviewed each influencer’s posts to identify instances when the dietitian at least once promoted a product, brand or industry-sponsored message. This included using a “Paid Partnership” tag on the post, mentioning personalized discount codes or writing “#ad” or “#sponsored” in the post description. These criteria were selected based on the Federal Trade Commission’s   guidelines   for social media influencers.   Reporters manually reviewed feeds and defined posts as having an unclear disclosure if the post (1) was promotional but had no clear disclosure, (2) was labeled as an ad but the brand sponsoring the post was unclear (e.g. the use of a vague “partner” tag instead of a brand mention), or (3) had a sponsorship disclosure but the “ad” mention was placed deep in the description of the post."},{"score":0.15778663754463196,"title":"Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Corporate Capture of the Nutrition Profession","id":"https://organicconsumers.org/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-corporate-capture-of-the-nutrition-profession-2/","url":"https://organicconsumers.org/academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-corporate-capture-of-the-nutrition-profession-2/","publishedDate":"2023-08-03","author":"OCA","text":"August 3, 2023 | Source: U.S. Right To Know | by Stacy Malkan\n  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics – the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, with over 100,000 credentialed dietitians, nutrition practitioners and students – is one of the most influential professional health associations in the U.S.\nThis fact sheet discusses the Academy’s relationship with ultra-processed food, beverage, pesticide and pharmaceutical corporations, including accepting contributions from and even investing in those companies.

The National Coffee Association put forth an academic who said coffee consumption is tied to lower risk of certain cancers. The soy industry nominated a prominent vegan. The International Bottled Water Association? They like three researchers who study the benefits of — you guessed it — water.\nThe normally secret nominations, which were obtained by STAT via a Freedom of Information Act request, demonstrate the food industry’s persistent efforts to influence the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other bodies that regulate nutrition and health in the United States. The panel in question, chosen by the USDA and HHS, deliberates the latest nutrition science for the better part of two years and then submits a report to regulators, who then decide on any ultimate tweaks to the national dietary guidelines.\n“Food companies are not social service agencies, and they’re not public health agencies, they’re businesses,” said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “You do not want dietary guidelines to say anything negative about your products, and [food companies] will go to whatever lengths are necessary to make sure that no federal agency says anything negative about their products.”\nThe nominations are not completely outlandish: Nearly all of the researchers hold positions at prestigious universities. The researcher with potato ties is a dean of public health, for example. Nor are they always successful: Only the vegan and the coffee enthusiast made it onto the USDA panel this time. Both had endorsements from other professional groups.\nThe National Coffee Association, International Bottled Water Association, and National Potato Council all argued in statements that their nominations would help ensure the health impacts of their products are highlighted in the dietary guidelines. The soy association did not respond to request for comment.\n“America’s potato growers are due an equal seat in a process that we trust will ensure all scientifically sound information is considered as recommendations are made,” the potato council wrote in a statement.\nFood companies will have another shot at impacting the guidelines on Tuesday when food makers and other members of the public will present before the committee. The National Potato Council and the National Coffee Association will both be presenting at the meeting.\nIt’s not the first time that food companies have attempted to get their preferred experts on the panel. In 2019, Unilever, Barilla, the American Beverage Association, and the United Egg Producers all successfully got their preferred nominations onto the committee, according to Politico.\nIt wasn’t just food companies nominating striking people to serve this time around. Emily Oster, the economist and parenting expert, was nominated by her PR firm, which is run by a group of Obama administration alums. John Ioannidis, the Stanford researcher who was criticized for his views of Covid lockdowns, was also nominated by a co-author.\nSeveral organizations advocating for vegetable-centric diets also nominated experts that espouse their views. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and the Physicians Association for Nutrition USA, both of which advocate for plant-based diets, nominated four and five experts, respectively. The International Fresh Produce Association, whose board is chaired by a Walmart executive, also nominated three experts, each of whom has written about the importance of fresh fruits and vegetables.\nThe Physicians Committee described its nominations as a way to fight the “decades-long grip of the meat and dairy industry on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.”\nMost of the panelists chosen this time around were nominated by professional societies. Seven members ultimately chosen to serve, including both of the groups’ co-chairs, had the endorsement of the American Society for Nutrition. Four were nominated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\nBut many of the panel members still have ties to industry. The USDA releases a list of “conflicts of interest” with the panel, and noted that people on the committee have ties to the egg, beef, and dairy industries. Both the American Society for Nutrition and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have also been criticized for their ties to the food industry.\nLawmakers and advocacy groups in recent months have urged the USDA to do a more thorough job in vetting potential conflicts of interest on the committee.\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has called for the entire dietary guidelines process to be halted until the committee’s “conflicts of interest are resolved.”\nMost of his concerns appear to stem from the appointment of Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity researcher with financial ties to makers of the popular weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists. Cody Stanford was nominated to the committee by the National Council on Aging, according to the records obtained by STAT.\nThe National Council on Aging supports legislation to expand Medicare coverage for the weight loss drugs made by Novo Nordisk and has received funding from the company. An NCOA spokesperson told STAT, however, that “Novo Nordisk had no role in nominating Dr. Cody Stanford.”\n STAT’s coverage of the commercial determinants of health is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

Registered Dietitian Juliette Kellow explains…  \nThe start of a new year typically brings with it a barrage of food, diet and nutrition trends and fads that promise everything from weight loss and improved digestion to better sleep and increased mental capacity. Wherever our clients look, they’re faced with advice and information from newspapers, magazines, TV programmes, adverts, supermarkets, and social platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.\nBut while the new year may see the latest must-have ingredients and meal plans thrown into the nutrition spotlight, food trends and fads don’t actually start on the 1 January. Nor do they finish on the 31 December, ready for a new wave to take over at the strike of midnight. Trends and fads can emerge at any time. Some appear and disappear quickly, while others grow, evolve and last for years, even becoming mainstream. Others exist without us even realising. And national and global events can quickly stop predicted trends in their tracks and create new, unanticipated ones.\nThe topic of food trends and fads may seem disconnected from the scientific, evidence-based world that health professionals are familiar and comfortable with. But every single one of us, including our clients, are subjected to them on both a conscious and unconscious level every single day. As a result, even trends or fads that are short-lived or seem gimmicky, can influence and shift consumer behaviour towards certain ingredients, foods, meals or eating habits in both the short and long term. In turn, this has the potential to affect nutrient intakes, dietary balance and ultimately, health.\nFurthermore, clients, consumers and media often want a health professional’s expert opinion on the latest trends and fads. Do I need to eat this ancient grain I’ve been reading about? Should I buy a hydration drink that’s trending on TikTok? Will this food I saw on a TV show really help ease my menopause symptoms? Are ultra-processed foods as bad for me as this newspaper suggests? Is food cooked in an air fryer healthy and, if so, should I buy one? These are just a few examples of the types of questions we may be asked.\nIn short, it’s vital health professionals are familiar with the latest trends and fads, so they can provide clients, consumers and media with evidence-based advice on the benefits and pitfalls, together with suggestions on how they can be modified or included as part of a healthy, balanced and sustainable diet.\nBut where do trends and fads come from and how do they differ?\n  Trends vs fads  \nWhile trends and fads are often considered to be one and the same, they are in fact, different. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, they are defined as follows:\n  TREND – A general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving \n  FAD – A style, activity or interest that is very popular for a short period of time \nTrends are based on predictions or forecasts grounded in data. Global companies such as Mintel or Euromonitor, for example, have teams of industry experts and analysts who specialise in identifying past and present food trends and forecasting future ones using market research and consumer facts and figures. Food providers such as supermarkets, catering companies and food brands use this data – often alongside their own research – to identify trends in their market. This in turn, is then often used for developing new products or helping to decide where the focus should be for marketing, advertising and public relations. Some food companies e.g. Waitrose, Asda and Whole Foods, also create their own reports, including their predictions for the forthcoming year and highlighting their products that fit these trends.\nThe element of time is a key factor in defining whether something is a trend or a fad. Trends usually evolve slowly, build gradually and reflect a progression in time. They’re often long lasting and can lead to long-term change in culture. Often, they might not be obvious, resulting in consumers interacting with the trend on an unconscious level. For example, the trend for adding a salty flavour to traditionally sweet foods has developed over several years. While not promoted as a trend, consumers will likely have been exposed to it, for example, through TV cooking shows making salted caramel sauce, menus serving blue cheese ice cream with desserts, supermarkets selling sweet and salty popcorn, and food magazines including recipes like miso brownies. The end result is consumers adding more salt to their diets using sweet treats as the vehicle for this.\nMeanwhile, not all trends can be predicted! As seen in the past few years, major events that impact consumers can set up new and completely unpredictable trend pathways. The COVID pandemic is a prime example, where home-baking, family mealtimes, cooking from scratch, reducing food waste, and a renewed enthusiasm for canned and frozen foods quickly gripped the nation. Some of these, such as canned foods, have stood the test of time and continue to evolve, helped by consumer desire for budget-friendly foods.\nIn contrast to food trends, food fads tend to be unpredictable and often stem from social media platforms or traditional media spaces such as TV and newspapers. For example, they may result from a recipe that goes viral, a TV chef using a specifc ingredient that causes it to sell out, or a product recommended by a celebrity or influencer with a huge following. We even have the term ‘trending’ used to describe things that are popular on social media!\nFood fads seem to come out of nowhere, rapidly gain momentum and reflect a specific moment in time. Fads can also exist as part of a much bigger food trend, for example, school dinner cakes may have been a fad, but they appeared within a growing trend for nostalgic foods. Fads typically come and go quickly and don’t normally cause a change in culture – think of last year’s cottage cheese ice cream, watertok, grated frozen fruit and girl dinners! That’s not to say fads can’t stand the test of time. For example, putting avocado onto toast might initially have been considered a fad, but it’s stood the test of time and is now a staple on breakfast and brunch menus.\nMeanwhile, it’s important not to dismiss fads just because they often come and go quickly. Consumers typically make a conscious decision to connect and interact with fads, and even if they are short lived, they can still impact behaviour in the longer term. Imagine this scenario: a client sees #ButterBoard trending on TikTok and decides to make one when friends visit. After trying the butter board, the client remembers how much they like butter so swap the polyunsaturated spread they’ve been buying for years for butter instead! The butter board fad is over and has only been tried once, but it’s instigated a dietary change that’s led to an increase in saturated fat for that person, potentially affecting their heart health.\nThe reality is, both trends and fads filter into daily life through supermarkets, restaurants, TV food shows, advertising, newspapers, magazines, online sites, and social media platforms. This makes them visible and accessible to consumers, potentially influencing what they choose to eat, both in the short and long term. As trusted and credible sources of information, consumers, clients and media often look to health professionals for advice on the latest trends. They will also benefit from guidance on how to make the most of trends that have a positive impact on health and how to adapt trends to enjoy a diet that’s healthier, balanced and more sustainable.\nTo discover the key food trends for this coming year, watch our webinar on the A to Z of Foods Trends for 2024, presented by Juliette Kellow.\n  Further reading/listening  \nIndeed.

A post-pandemic focus on health and preventive nutrition, ongoing economic challenges, and more research into the health risks of ultra-processed foods are impacting consumer behaviour and healthy eating trends.\nMany of these factors have had a positive impact, causing a shift towards health-conscious eating. In Thailand, over two-thirds of consumers consider eating healthily a higher priority since the COVID-19 outbreak, and a similar trend was seen in India, where almost two-thirds of consumers decreased unhealthy snacking habits post-pandemic. However, the recent economic challenges have caused healthy eating to become less of a priority for some consumers. For example, although the majority of Germans eat healthy all or most of the time; Mintel found that in 2022, over half of Germans said that financial concerns were more important to them than weight management. This highlights how times of economic stress can make healthy eating habits less prevalent.\nNevertheless, when short-term challenges such as the income squeeze are discounted, Mintel’s market research has found a global shift towards health-conscious eating. In the UK, 68% of consumers claim to be eating healthily all or most of the time, and the same was seen across the Atlantic, with 74% of Canadians saying the same.\nThis highlights that despite ongoing challenges, healthy eating is still at the forefront of many consumers’ minds. In this article, we explore the latest trends impacting consumer approaches to healthy eating.\n Explore Mintel’s Extensive Health and Nutrition Research  \n All-Natural \nConsumers across the globe are prioritising natural foods over processed ones. Half of US consumers agree they would like to change their current diet by eating fewer processed foods. The clean label trend reflects consumers’ growing demand for transparency and naturalness in the foods they consume and ingredients of products are coming under increasing scrutiny. Almost half of Italian consumers agree that ‘natural ingredients’ are a top factor for them when food shopping. However, this heightened awareness of processed foods coincided with a higher cost of living, and while consumers are interested in minimally processed foods, the majority of consumers would not pay more for them, which presents a challenge for natural food brands.\nAs awareness of natural and processed foods increases, consumers are becoming more aware of the different levels of food processing and are distinguishing between processed and ultra-processed foods. Consumers are establishing their own balance of what they consider ‘good’ or ‘bad’ processing, with a preference for minimally processed foods that are nutritious, tasty, and affordable. However, despite all the scrutiny, 68% of UK consumers agree that highly processed foods are fine in moderation within a balanced diet. Brands need to provide clear communication to help consumers make informed decisions about how processed foods fit into a balanced diet, and provide ‘better-for-you’ alternatives to indulgent ultra-processed favourites to make comfort eating healthier. \n Dieting for Holistic Health \nThe definition of healthy is evolving and becoming more holistic, taking the lead from the WHO’s definition of health: ‘Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.’ Naturally, this has affected on many consumers’ approach to healthy eating, as a good diet is an essential part of good health. Over two-thirds of German consumers claim that what you eat has a direct impact on your emotional wellbeing.\n  Dieting for holistic health includes foods that nurture mood and mind. Source: Gettyimages.  \nDieting for holistic health focuses not only on physical health and weight management, but also on mental and social wellness. Consumers are not just looking for healthy food in a traditional sense (low calorie, sugar-free, etc.), but also foods that nurture mood and mind. The link between the gut microbiome and overall health is being increasingly recognised by science and consumers. This has been reflected in the market. Mintel’s GNPD data shows that 22% of global food/drink/healthcare introductions with a digestive health claim in the past five years also had an immune health claim. There is an opportunity for brands to expand on this, with new product development and on-pack messaging. Other holistic health trends also present an opportunity, such as anti-inflammatory diets, which are linked to cognitive health and are growing in popularity with health-conscious consumers.\nWithin holistic dieting, there is also a growing trend that focuses on social issues. The eco dieting trend is a response to growing concerns about the sustainability of food production and the impact of diets on both human and planetary health. Over the past few years, the rise in the adoption of plant-based diets and their link to planetary health has been hard to ignore. But the eco dieting trend goes far beyond cutting down on meat and fish consumption, and encompasses a complete sustainable outlook. Product sourcing and production methods are becoming increasingly important. Products being sourced and produced domestically are a top sustainability-related interest area for consumers all over Europe. Even processed foods are not immune from scrutiny, over half of UK consumers have checked the meat’s country of origin on a processed meat product in the last three months. Innovative solutions to food sustainability challenges are needed.\n Preventative Measures \nAgeing populations, coupled with rising concern over the prevalence of diet-related health issues, have created a growing adoption of eating patterns that support consumers’ long-term health. More consumers are now looking at ‘food as medicine’, focusing on diet and nutrition’s role in the prevention of health conditions. The longevity dieting trends focus on developing foods and eating patterns that not only support an extended lifespan but also enhance the quality of life by emphasising the protective role of diet on health. This includes ready meals designed for blood sugar management, such as Nestlé’s Lean Cuisine Balance Bowl in the US, and Be Fit Food Thai Green Chicken Curry in Australia. \n  Nestle’s Lean Cuisine Balance Bowl’s are one of many products launched in response to consumer demand for preventive nutrition. Source: Nestlé  \nInnovations in longevity dieting also address weight management through the development of appetite suppressors and research on unprocessed foods (UPFs), which are expected to further increase demand for less-processed foods. Products that help with appetite regulation, such as those containing fibre and chromium, are part of the trend towards healthy weight management, and there is also emerging research which suggests that texture plays a role in regulating appetite, highlighting a potential focus for new product development.\n Looking Ahead with Mintel \nHolistic dieting trends that encompass mind, body, and planet are likely to grow, particularly as more research into the dangers of ultra-processed foods emerge, and environmental and sustainability issues return to the forefront of consumers’ minds as financial pressure decreases. Brands in the healthy eating market will need to keep consumers’ changing demands and concerns in mind when it comes to new product development in order to build a successful future in the category.\n  Subscribe to our free newsletter, Spotlight, to get exclusive content and insights delivered directly to your inbox.  \n Sign up to Spotlight  \nMintel’s Most Innovative Food &amp; Drink\n  Mintel is constantly tracking innovation, identifying trends and gaining insights.

The sector has evolved across all its component parts, from food preparation to packaging, restauration, home delivery, and homemade. Social media has become a powerful force that propels food trends to spread rapidly through our cultural consciousness. Whether it's those yawn-inducing people who only talk about their latest air-fryer inventions or the gorgeous gorgeous girlies of #SoupTok who proclaim their love for the velvety comfort health food (who doesn't?!). \n On the other side of the coin, artificial intelligence (AI) has infiltrated the preparation side of F&amp;B and is helping create efficiencies, make smarter business decisions and support a greener future. Whilst we don't have a crystal ball to see the future trends, ultimately all forecasts suggest that in 2024 consumers are looking for convenience, value for money, and -of course - taste like never before in relation to food and drink. \nWe've scowered the latest F&amp;B research and trends reports from the likes of Mintel, Wholefoods and The Specialty Food Association to name a few, paired with our internal expert opinions from EHL's Practical Arts Professors, to compile a comprehensive and balanced list of the this year's top trends in the Food and Beverage Industry.\nFood and Beverage industry background\nBefore we jump into the top trends in F&amp;B let's make sure we're all on the same page.\nFood and drink trends are currently being shaped by two core drivers, firstly technology - namely AI - and secondly, consumer demands, for which both have experienced a big evolution. The following sections delve into those in more detail before we get to the much-anticipated trends!\nTechnology in F&amp;B\nAs technological advances play an ever-important role in the industry, the next big thing is getting into consumer’s homes. Companies have begun connecting the dots when it comes to consumer convenience, so the quest for dominating the online grocery shopping is on.\nApproaching technology from a new perspective will also reap some greatly promising benefits in the future. Metis co-founder David Richey, who had helped set the quality and service standards which became the industry benchmark, says technology has been disappointing so far.\nThe principle use has been for better slicing and dicing of customer data for history and preferences - and for better targeting and analyzing populations for marketing purposes. But why haven’t we used AI more as a management resource?\nHe cites the possibility of using weather, finance and population data to forecast beef prices up to 24 months in advance or buy cattle futures to hedge the market. Social media analysis could be used along with demographic data to predict wine trends which could then result in contracts with local producers.\n Going cashless. Restaurateurs are beginning to phase out cash in their operations. This saves them time by avoiding bank deposits and also has obvious operational benefits: fewer handling errors and incidents of theft; and instead, greater transparency and liquidity. Either way, the industry is heading towards a cashless future with simplified payments made easy through PIN-less card contact payments or ApplePay. We could be looking at future payments through electronic fingerprints, retina scans or even facial recognition.\nChanging consumer mindset\n Continual exploration of global flavors is ongoing, with an increasing interest in diverse tastes worldwide. According to Trendspotters, consumers are not only embracing new flavors but also seeking deeper cultural connections through food. Trendspotter V. Sheree Williams predicts a rise in traditional heritage foods crafted by small producers globally, highlighting recipes rich in both flavor and personal narratives. This trend reflects a growing awareness and appreciation for obscure regional ingredients and culinary traditions. The evolving landscape of restaurants across the U.S. is introducing consumers to lesser-known cuisines and specific dishes within them, broadening their willingness to explore new culinary experiences. This shift underscores the recognition that cuisines are diverse and multifaceted, as observed particularly in the popularity of Asian packaged products catering to a wide consumer base. Additionally, there's a forecasted surge in interest in African pantry items, as brands aim to familiarize Western tastes with African flavors and"},{"score":0.14922121167182922,"title":"Personalized Nutrition And Supplements Market Report, 2030","id":"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/personalized-nutrition-supplements-market-report","url":"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/personalized-nutrition-supplements-market-report","publishedDate":"2023-10-01","author":"","text":"Report Overview \nThe global personalized nutrition and supplements market size was valued at USD 43.40 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.0% from 2023 to 2030. The increasing consumer health awareness and growing demand for retail nutrition products are expected to drive the global industry. Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body’s optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers’ preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual’s health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals’ needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population. Similarly, India is emerging as a hub for startups in the personalized nutrition and supplements market. For instance, in April 2020, BhookhaHaathi, an Indian nutraceutical startup, launched AI-based personalized nutrition services. The system collects relevant information to offer customized suggestions. The company is extending its current nutraceutical business.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe constant demand for personalized nutrition &amp; supplement solutions by multiple end-users has created numerous growth opportunities for major players to capitalize on. For instance, in August 2022, Amway announced that it will invest in a microbiome-based startup called Holzapfel Effective Microbes (HEM) to offer tailored probiotic supplement solutions. Amway committed to the second-round investment with HEM, which assists individuals with incurable diseases associated with microbiome dysfunction. The company is actively searching for collaboration opportunities with startups from the U.S., South Korea, Thailand, China, and Indonesia.

Food fortifying agents are used to address nutrient deficiencies and improve the overall nutritional profile of food products. These agents may include vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that may be lacking in the diet or may be lost during food processing. The global market for food fortifying agents has been growing as consumers become more conscious of their health and nutrition. Fortified foods offer a convenient way to ensure that individuals receive essential nutrients, especially when certain nutrients are not naturally present in sufficient quantities in the diet. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global  food fortifying agents market  size is projected to reach USD 128.0 Billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 10.1% from 2022 to 2027.  Download PDF Brochure:  https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=72061350   Need of Food Fortifying Agents in the Minerals Segment    Nutrient Deficiencies: Many individuals may not obtain enough essential minerals through their regular diet. Factors such as poor dietary choices, limited food variety, and soil depletion of minerals can contribute to deficiencies. Fortifying foods with minerals help ensure that people receive an adequate intake to support overall health.  Public Health Initiatives: Governments and health organizations often implement public health initiatives to address specific nutritional challenges within populations. Fortifying staple foods with minerals is a targeted and cost-effective way to reach a large segment of the population and prevent widespread deficiencies.  Prevention of Health Conditions: Certain minerals are critical for the prevention of various health conditions. For example, fortifying foods with iron can help combat iron deficiency anemia, especially in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and young children. Similarly, calcium fortification is important for bone health and can contribute to the prevention of conditions like osteoporosis.  Targeted Nutrition: Food fortification allows for targeted nutrition, addressing the specific needs of different demographic groups. For instance, fortifying foods with iodine is crucial for preventing iodine deficiency disorders, particularly in regions where natural sources of iodine are limited.  Convenience and Accessibility: Fortifying commonly consumed foods with minerals ensures that individuals can easily incorporate these nutrients into their diet without significant changes in eating habits. This approach is particularly valuable in addressing nutrient gaps in populations where access to a diverse range of foods is limited.  Compliance with Dietary Guidelines: Fortification aligns with dietary guidelines that recommend adequate intake of essential minerals. It helps bridge the gap between recommended nutrient levels and actual consumption, promoting a more balanced and healthful diet.

This surge is not only a testament to the region's economic growth but also mirrors a growing interest among middle-class consumers in nutrition and supplements. Omega-3 nutritional supplements, renowned for their health benefits, are particularly in demand, symbolizing a shift towards proactive health management. Proteins and amino acids stand out as dynamic segments across the Asia Pacific, with key markets including China, India, Japan, and Australia &amp; New Zealand. These countries, rich in agriculture, play a pivotal role in the production of high-fiber content plants and oilseeds, serving as primary raw materials for fiber and specialty carbohydrate ingredients.  Transformative Shift in Food Industry  The processed food industry in the Asia Pacific region undergoes a metamorphosis, responding to changing customer lifestyles shaped by rapid urbanization, diet diversification, and liberalization of foreign direct investment. Rising incomes and increased purchasing power fuel a dramatic transformation in the food &amp; beverage sector, with consumers expressing a heightened demand for nutritional and healthy products. This confluence of factors presents promising prospects for growth and diversification in the region's food sector, further driving the demand for food fortifying agents.  Conclusion  In this dynamic landscape, key players such as Cargill (US), DSM (Netherlands), CHR. Hansen Holdings A/S (Denmark), DuPont (US), BASF SE (Germany), Arla Foods Amba (Denmark), Tate &amp; Lyle (UK), Ingredion (US), Archer Daniels Midland Company (US), and Nestle SA (Switzerland) play pivotal roles. As the food fortifying agents market journeys towards a fortified future, guided by the dietary supplements application and the nutritional awakening of the Asia Pacific region, we witness not just a market evolution but a transformative shift in how we perceive and prioritize our nutritional choices. The path ahead is one paved with innovation, health consciousness, and a commitment to holistic well-being.

These supplements are made from soy, pea, hemp, spirulina, pumpkin seeds, and rice, and they provide a more sustainable and ethical alternative to animal-based protein products. The market is being driven by increased global demand for vegan and vegetarian products, with e-commerce playing an important role in making them more accessible. Retail behemoths like Wal-Mart are pushing their suppliers to provide more plant-based options, indicating the market's potential for development. Furthermore, health-conscious consumers are switching to vegan diets to minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to meat intake. The glutamic problems and lactose intolerance are also gaining popularity in the market.\n Global Plant Based Protein Supplements  Market Dynamics \n Market Drivers \nIncreasing demand for  protein supplements  to improve health and wellness\nRise in number of vegan population\nConcerns about the environmental impact of meat production and animal agriculture\nGrowth in investment &amp; collaboration in plant-based food business\n Market Restraints \nPresence of cheaper substitutes\nPlant-based protein supplements are more expensive\n Market Opportunities \nRise in number of millennial populations\nDevelop convenient and sustainable packaging solutions to reduce environmental impact\nRise of  social media marketing  \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Report Coverage \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Insights \nGrowing concerns regarding the use of animal-based protein supplements have compelled manufacturers to develop human nutrition products derived from plant-based sources such as soy, spirulina, pumpkin seeds, hemp, peas, and rice.\nThe plant-based protein supplements market is expected to experience significant growth due to the increasing global demand for vegan products. The rapid expansion of e-commerce has contributed to the consumption of protein supplements. Walmart, as the largest retailer, is encouraging its suppliers to offer more plant-based items. Additionally, the rising concern for food safety in the food and beverage sector is driving the demand for high-quality food service and liquid packaging boards.\nThe growing importance of a vegan diet, driven by concerns about cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes associated with the consumption of meat products, is expected to positively impact market growth. The global market is projected to witness substantial growth over the next eight years, driven by the increasing population of flexitarians in the United States and Canada, thanks to extensive campaigns promoting vegetarian diets through various media platforms.\nFurthermore, the rising awareness of glutamic disorders and lactose intolerance among millennials in developed markets like Germany and the United States is expected to boost the consumption of soy and pea protein supplements. Many manufacturers distribute their products through various channels, including e-commerce portals, direct sales contracts, and supermarkets. These products are available in various forms, such as powder, liquids, ready-to-drink (RTD) options, and capsules.      \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Segmentation \nThe worldwide market for plant based protein supplements is split based on product, application, distribution channel, raw material, and geography.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Products \nProtein Powder\nProtein Bars\nReady-to-Drink (RTD)\nOthers\nThe protein powder category leads the plant-based protein supplements sector due to its diversity and ease. Protein powders are simple to add into a variety of dishes and beverages, giving consumers greater flexibility in their use. Furthermore, they are frequently regarded as a pure and concentrated source of plant-based protein, making them a favoured choice for people attempting to reach their daily protein intake targets. Protein powder's versatility and nutritional worth have catapulted it to market leadership.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Applications \nSports Nutrition\nAdditional Nutrition\nSports nutrition dominates the market for plant-based protein supplements due to rising demand from athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Plant-based protein supplements are in line with the emerging trend of clean and sustainable nutrition, and they appeal to people looking for protein sources that help with muscle recovery, performance, and overall health. These supplements provide an effective solution for physically active people to achieve their protein needs while still adhering to their dietary preferences and environmental considerations. Increased participation in sports and fitness activities by health-conscious consumers has propelled the sports nutrition segment to market leadership in the plant-based protein supplements market.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Distribution Channels \nSupermarket\nOnline Stores\nDTC\nOthers\nFor numerous reasons, the online store segment leads the plant-based protein supplements industry. For starters, it provides consumers with convenience by allowing them to browse and purchase a wide range of things from the comfort of their own homes. Second, online platforms give plant-based protein supplement makers access to a global market, broadening their reach. Furthermore, internet retailers frequently offer competitive pricing, promotions, and customer feedback, which improves the whole purchasing experience. As more people turn to e-commerce for their nutritional needs, the online retailers category continues to prosper as the preferred distribution channel for plant-based protein supplements.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Raw Materials \nSoy\nSpirulina\nPumpkin Seed\nHemp\nRice\nPea\nOthers\nWihin the raw material segment the soy sub-segment held the largest share of the market. The soy segment's dominance in the plant-based protein supplements market can be ascribed to many important factors.\nComplete protein profile is an important aspect in boosting growth. Soy protein is regarded as a high-quality, complete protein source, containing adequate amounts of all essential amino acids. This makes it a popular choice among consumers searching for a complete protein supplement with an amino acid profile similar to that of animal-based proteins.\nAnother motivator is nutritional value. Iron, calcium, and B vitamins are among the necessary minerals found in soy protein. Because of its nutritional fullness and versatility, it is an appealing option for individuals looking for a well-rounded dietary supplement.\n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Regional Outlook \n North America \nU.S.\nCanada\n Europe \nU.K.\nGermany\nFrance\nSpain\nRest of Europe\n Asia-Pacific \nIndia\nJapan\nChina\nAustralia\nSouth Korea\nRest of Asia-Pacific\n Latin America \nBrazil\nMexico\nRest of Latin America\n The Middle East &amp; Africa \nSouth Africa\nGCC Countries\nRest of the Middle East &amp; Africa (ME&amp;A)\n \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Regional Analysis \nNorth America accounted for 41% of the global revenue share in 2022. The increasing awareness of vegan diets and the growing trend toward vegetarianism, driven by new brand campaigns on social media and television, is expected to drive the demand for plant-based protein supplements in the near future. The demand in the U.S. is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period due to the increasing consumption of sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, rising concerns about weight management and growing consumer awareness of the importance of a nutritious diet and a healthy lifestyle are expected to support regional market growth over the forecast period.\nEurope has a thriving industry for plant-based products, including supplements. This market's progress is fueled by factors comparable to those in North America, such as rising health consciousness, environmental concerns, and the growing popularity of vegan and vegetarian diets.\nAsia-Pacific is projected to remain one of the most profitable markets for plant-based protein supplements in the next eight years. The growth of the middle-class population in developing countries, including China and India, along with increased state government spending on infrastructure development and a favorable taxation environment for multinational companies (MNCs) to establish offices, is expected to drive demand.\n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Players \nSome of the top plant based protein supplements companies offered in our report includes Glanbia plc, AMCO Proteins, Quest Nutrition, NOW Foods, The Bountiful Company, MusclePharm Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, IOVATE Health Sciences International, Inc., Transparent Labs, and WOODBOLT DISTRIBUTION LLC."},{"score":0.21592222154140472,"title":"Impact of the top four key food themes on Asia","id":"https://retailinasia.com/in-sectors/impact-of-the-top-four-key-food-themes-on-asia/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=impact-of-the-top-four-key-food-themes-on-asia","url":"https://retailinasia.com/in-sectors/impact-of-the-top-four-key-food-themes-on-asia/","publishedDate":"2023-08-25","author":"EUROMONITOR","text":"Source: Shutterstock\n \nDespite Asia’s relatively soft inflation rates compared with several other global regions, cost-of-living pressures are continuing to play a major role in shaping consumer preferences in 2023 and leading up to 2024.\n SEE ALSO: Lion takes full control of Australia’s Four Pillars  \nIn addition, travel resumption has meant changing day-to-day lifestyles and consumer values in terms of priority product attributes; all of which make for overarching shifts in key food themes in Asia Pacific.\n The evolution of health-conscious eating \nConsumers are prioritising holistic lifestyles, recognising the importance of a healthy diet for physical and mental wellbeing, and Asian consumers are no exception. The top two definitions of health selected by surveyed respondents in Asia are “mental wellbeing” and “having a healthy immune system” according to the Euromonitor International Voice of the Consumer: Health and Nutrition Survey.\nThis highlights the need for functional ingredients targeting the gut-brain axis and specific need states such as memory, stress, and sleep to provide consumers with products that can help them achieve their health goals.\nStrong aversion to sugar and high carbohydrate/calorie foods is also an important factor to consider in Asia, partially driven by health conditions such as the high prevalence of heart issues: one in five Asians in 2022 was reported to suffer from high blood pressure.\n Source: Shutterstock \n Away from animals: Plant-based, cell-cultured and more \nGlobally, analogues for animal-based food are improving in terms of their spread across food categories, product development, penetration of market channels, and consumer awareness. The commercialisation of cell-cultured meat in the US is also a sign that meat analogues are fast developing beyond simply plant-based products, although plant-based meat and seafood substitutes in Hong Kong and Thailand, in particular, are showing strong positive forecast growth despite the latter having only established a sizable presence in 2021.\nTechnology and synergies with regulation will have a major role to play in the development of animal-based analogues in Asia. Particular challenges include price and taste, especially given the diversity of cuisines. However, with Singapore being a major hub for innovation (not just in the region, but also globally), it can be expected that further innovation will propel the industry forward. A recent win is Solein, a protein ingredient made via fermentation from oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and mineral nutrients. First launched as part of a menu showcase in Singapore in May 2023, it is promoted as “protein made from thin air”.\n Source: Shutterstock \n The evolution of snacking and eating occasions \nEating occasions and snacking patterns have been altered by global events. With the reopening of travel and formal workspaces, the out-of-home market is undergoing a resurgence.\nAccording to the Euromonitor International Voice of the Consumer: Lifestyles Survey (fielded in February 2023), 46 percent of Asian consumers claim that they typically eat snacks at home, in contrast to 53 percent in 2022, 54 percent in 2021, and 50 percent in 2020. This highlights a marginal fall in home occasions. Nevertheless, there is stickiness to at-home eating occasions compared to pre-pandemic years.\nHabits in ordering food to-go and the strengthening of digital and delivery infrastructures supporting remote consumption will remain relevant. This is predicted to lead to a decline in the percentage of the eat-in segment in Asia Pacific’s consumer foodservice industry, at least in the short term.\n Source: Shutterstock \n Premiumisation and affordability in food \nInflationary pressures continue to disrupt food markets in 2023, impacting both products of higher specific value and commodities as the cost-of-living crisis continues. In South Korea, the term “lunchflation” was coined, whereby lunch meals became increasingly expensive to consumers, who then reduced eating out occasions. Instead, many of them are now making the switch to instant foods from convenience stores that are more affordable. Even so, ready meals, which are perceived as offering specific benefits such as convenience and accessibility, are seeing steady price growth.\nThere is greater emphasis then, on what makes a product “premium” and motivates consumer spending. In developed markets in Asia, such as Japan, “locally-sourced or manufactured” ranks high as one of the most influential food and drink features in 2023, according to the Euromonitor International Voice of the Consumer: Lifestyles Survey, indicating expectations of quality and local expertise. In contrast, emerging market consumers in Asia, such as in India and the Philippines, favour attributes such as environmental welfare and organic.\n The future of eating in Asia \nCost-of-living pressures will remain a short-term challenge for businesses to address, as prices continue to climb and food supplies are affected by severe weather volatilities, thereby driving the cost of commodities upwards. Price strategies and scrutiny of consumer habits will play out over the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.\nNevertheless, in Euromonitor International’s Voice of the Consumer: Lifestyles Survey, 36 percent of Asian consumers responded that they intend to increase their spending on groceries up to 2024. In contrast, only 13 percent of them said they intend to reduce their spending on groceries, pointing towards a larger acceptance of having to spend more on food.\n SEE ALSO: Hong Kong’s Swire Pacific to sell Coca-Cola unit  \nBusinesses will pay greater attention to premiumisation strategies to draw out value growth, such as introducing specific health benefits and features to their food products, and leveraging the plant-based trend. A long-term strategy will also involve studying consumption occasions, especially given the rapidly developing digitalisation ecosystem in both grocery and foodservice delivery."},{"score":0.20851153135299683,"title":"17 food and drink trends to watch in 2024","id":"https://www.specialityfoodmagazine.com/food-and-drink/17-food-and-drink-trends-to-watch-in-2024","url":"https://www.specialityfoodmagazine.com/food-and-drink/17-food-and-drink-trends-to-watch-in-2024","publishedDate":"2024-01-01","author":"","text":"Sustainability\n   \nThe increasing awareness of environmental impact through food and drink consumption has heavily influenced market dynamics, with ShelfNow reporting a heightened demand for sustainable food brands. “Notably, between 2020 and 2023, our platform recorded an average 120% year-on-year increase in sales of products with sustainable packaging,” said marketing manager, Athena Lee. \n“Concern for the planet influences the eco-minded home cook more than ever as the effects of climate change become a daily reality that we must all grapple with,” added Stylus’ Mandy Saven. “There is a desire to safeguard the planet, and this is reflected in people’s cooking and dining behaviours. However, the stark reality of the cost-of-living crisis is that consumers must reconcile the tensions between affordability and sustainability.” \n“In reality, shopping behaviours are not solely guided by altruism,” agrees Kate Kehoe of FMCG Gurus, whose 2023 data shows eight out of 10 people globally would be more likely to trust a company that farms regeneratively. \n“They are conscious of the impact of climate change on food production systems, and the role agriculture has to play. Brands must showcase resourcefulness across the supply chain to align with consumer values.” Retailers and brands should also, though, remember that “environmental messages can be overwhelming, particularly during uncertain times, and the association of such products with higher prices can deter customers. Therefore, brands should emphasise the value of environmental products by highlighting additional benefits.” \n Flavours Less Travelled  \nAuthenticity is one of the key drivers behind Bidfood’s 2024 trends report, with 56% of consumers saying they would pay more for a product or dish if they perceived it as authentic. “This is heavily reinforced in our Flavours Less Travelled trend, giving consumers the opportunity to feel their sense of adventure by exploring cuisines in their most original format.” The cuisines most piquing interest are Caribbean, Eastern European, and Mexican. \n“There’s growing demand for Caribbean dishes like rich, spicy stews that feature seafood, indigenous vegetables and meats such as goat,” says Bidfood, which adds that Eastern European food is also becoming more well-known and appreciated thanks to formats that are familiar to the UK market. \n Speciality Food has already reported on tequila and other Mexican spirits and drinks as a huge emerging market in Britain, and Bidfood says that although 44% of consumers have already tried Mexican cuisine, they now want to experience it in more traditional formats. “Operators should look towards authentic classics like marinated pork belly tacos, or charred corn elotes with chicken.” \nWhole Foods Market’s trends report for 2024 similarly picks out Mexican as a ‘must-stock’ for retailers. “Ingredients and foods that haven’t always been mainstream are now coming to the forefront. Consumers are exploring flavours of Mexico beyond the taco. You can now find products like botana sauces, to-go tamales and tepache ready-to-drink beverages on shelves.” \n Food Fashion  \nStylus has noticed a pattern of prestigious fashion and jewellery brands launching into hospitality “with premium eateries serving as accessible entry point for consumers wanting to experience a touch of brand magic.” \nThe forecasting expert says luxury brands can benefit from developing complementary food or drink offerings that “encapsulate their aspirational attributes.” \n“For instance, a shopper might not be able to purchase a Prada bag, but they’ll relish the chance to tuck into a delectable pastry from the Prada Caffe at Harrods in London.” \n \n Feeling the heat  \nGlobally-sourced chilli peppers are taking off as consumers seek ever more complex ways to experience heat, says Whole Foods Market, citing products such as My Neighbours The Dumplings Chilli Sauce, Wilderbee Hot Honey, and The Garden of Eva Watermelon Chili Jam as products that typify what customers are looking for. It expects speciality chillies such as Carolina Reaper, Scorpion, Guajillo and Hungarian Goathorn to be seen more widely, be that fresh, whole, ground, pickled, preserved in oil, or used in sauces, dips and relishes. \n    \nTech  \nShelfNow predicts a sharp rise in the number of food and drinks businesses utilising AI and machine learning, says Athena Lee, with the insight expert anticipating more adoption of AI-powered solutions that revolutionise supply chain management. \n“By analysing sales data and other factors, AI can accurately predict demand patterns, allowing businesses to optimise inventory levels, reduce costs, and minimise food waste,” Athena says. \n“These technological advancements streamline operations and enhance the food and beverage buyer experience. Personalised product recommendations, real-time order tracking, and chatbot support are just a few of the ways AI is increasing buyer satisfaction.” \n Mind and Mood  \nAround 48% of consumers are seeking out foods that directly impact their physical wellbeing, and 71% say they feel the aroma of food and drink can help boost their mood, says Bidfood. “This trend centres around consumers shifting priorities when it comes to their health and wellbeing. Not just their physical health, but also their mental health and state of mind.” \nWhole Foods Market has also picked up on this growing market sector, but with a particular leaning towards women’s health. “On social media we’ve seen hormonal remedy recipes go viral, including raw carrot salad for oestrogen management, seed cycling energy bites for each cycle phase, and ‘sleepy girl mocktails’. We’re seeing more brands making products to support periods, pregnancy, postpartum, menopause and even sleep that address life stages and symptoms previously swept under the rug.” \n Luxury Food Pairings  \n“In the fine food realm, in 2024, progressive food and drink pairings will continue to challenge flavour conventions and imbue the fine dining landscape with exciting nuance,” says Mandy Sevan of Stylus. Customers with cash to splash will continue to invest, she adds, in luxury food experiences involving complex flavours, hard-to-source ingredients, next-level freshness, and culinary craftsmanship. “This includes artisanal edibles – from tangy, buttery cheeses and slivers of prestige-grade ham, to succulent cherries.” \n British Fusion  \nAlthough consumers are becoming more adventurous, they’re still reluctant to spend money on cuisines they aren’t familiar with. This is where British fusion comes in, with Bidfood revealing 68% of people find this concept appealing, and 35% feeling it bridges the gap between the exciting flavours of global cuisine, and the familiarity of homegrown classics. “Try mixing up your Sunday roasts, English breakfasts, or even desserts such as crumbles with interesting global flavours.” \n Maximising Value\n   \nFMCG Gurus’ trends report shows more than half of global consumers are looking to reduce their spend on food and drink due to rising prices. The report believes they will adopt habits in line with economic downturns, and that brand loyalty will decrease, with consumers being more open to exploring different products. “Brands should respond by introducing packaging advancements to prolong the shelf life of products,” says Kate Kehoe, who also says that although cutbacks in daily essentials are being seen, customers across most categories are still “seeking more high-end indulgences through retail channels.” And that it’s “vital that these indulgences remain reasonably priced and do not lead to post-consumption guilt.” \n \n \nTreat Moments  \nTikTok creators have brought ‘little treat’ culture into the zeitgeist, says Whole Foods Market. “We know firsthand the power of a treat, like an impulse macaron buy or a fizzy, functional and flavour-forward drink.” Brands are getting in on the trend, it says, by considering both cost and format, “like individual serving packages that add joy without breaking a budget.”\n \n Know your noodles  \n“Shoppers have been finding ways to dress up instant ramen at home for years now,” says Whole Foods Market, “but as brands step up their game, noodle lovers can take on less of the workload. Even better, brands are creating more gourmet options to rival the classics, without certain preservatives and added MSG.” \n Premium Playful Drinks  \n“In the forthcoming year alcohol brands will deliver premiumised products for consumers wanting to feel inspired, indulgent and discerning, even if they possess little industry knowledge,” says Stylus. \nMany of these products will be driven by social media. As Bidfood notes in its 2024 trends report, consumers can’t resist taking pictures of their cocktails to post on their accounts, with 43% of 18 to 35-year-olds doing this every time. “To leverage this trend, operators are starting to take their cocktail offerings to the next level, creating imaginative, theatrical and themed serves.” More of this innovation should also trickle into the RTD cocktail and mixed drinks sector, which is growing rapidly. \n A Natural Boost  \nConsumers are demanding more from their coffee and soft drinks, seeking products that claim to boost their health as well as delivering on flavour. There are lots of new ways for them to get their pick-me-up, says Whole Foods Market, which predicts functional coffee and sodas will continue to grow as a category in 2024. “Combining a boost with benefits has never been easier thanks to new coffee and energy drinks with added mushrooms, probiotics and more.” \n Rustic and Rural  \nFarm to fork concepts, provenance and menu stories are becoming increasingly popular, says Bidfood. “Consumers are making more mindful choices about where and what they eat when out of home. Cosy décor, handmade pasta and bakery products, garden salads, heritage produce and open flame cooking are ways operators can tap into this trend.” \n Clean and Conserve  \nBrands across sectors are promoting water conservation, says Whole Foods Market’s report, and consumers are listening. “New water brands use water from fruit by-products which would otherwise be discarded. As well as the growing trend of regenerative agriculture, non-governmental organisations are also showing their support of farmed oysters, leveraging aquaculture to filter water and help restore coastal ecosystems.” It’s worth looking at your non-consumable offering in store too – seeking out water conscious products such as dry shampoos, shampoo bars and laundry detergent sheets. \n Keep it Fun  \nDuring the cost-of-living crisis, everyone’s looking for something to cheer them up. Something exciting and out of the ordinary. Bidfood believes food retailers and producers have a part to play here in 2024 by bringing a hint of fun to their products and environment. “Colour, playful presentation, novel styling and a touch of theatre will certainly tick the boxes to offer the experience desired,” it says. “Mixing flavours is another way of adding novelty, and can really elevate a dish. In fact, 70% of consumers find the idea of flavour contrasts appealing, with sweet and sour being the most popular.” \n \n Plant-Based Goes Back to its Roots  \nIn 2023 some products aimed at the vegan/vegetarian market disappeared from shelves, as companies failed to pivot and respond to increasing consumer desire to eat ‘real’ food, that’s as minimally processed as possible. Whole Foods Market says retailers wanting to stay ahead of the game should be stocking food that puts the ‘veggie’ back into vegetarian. “We’re seeing new and emerging protein-forward products with mushrooms, walnuts, tempeh and legumes in place of complex meat alternatives,” it reveals."},{"score":0.20600977540016174,"title":"A to Z of Food Trends for 2024","id":"https://mynutriweb.com/a-to-z-of-food-trends-for-2024/","url":"https://mynutriweb.com/a-to-z-of-food-trends-for-2024/","publishedDate":"2023-11-07","author":"Admin","text":"CONTENT AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n Food trends can influence and shift the behaviour of consumers towards certain ingredients, foods, meals or eating habits.

Reminisce about recipes that went viral and find out what might happen next by continuing to read our 2024 food trend predictions.\nWhat we loved in 2023 In the past year, we saw increased interest in plant-based eating, affordability, sustainability initiatives, and intuitive eating—a dietary approach that abandons harmful diet culture and prioritizes hunger cues instead. People were also more concerned about their alcohol intake, and many people reduced their consumption by switching to mocktails and other non-alcoholic beverages. The “sober curious” movement originated in 2018. Still, it may have taken off in 2023 due to new Canadian alcohol guidelines published in early 2023 (fourteen weekly drinks were reduced to two) that swept the news.\nA few 2023 food trends we watched on Tiktok (a social media platform that hosts videos) include: \nViral cheesy and meat-baked spaghetti\nItalian deli meat-chopped sandwich\nWatermelon “fries”\nA fruit roll-up with ice cream and frozen grapes\nThis is the tip of the iceberg regarding viral videos on TikTok. Most creators produced recipes that were either nutritious, comforting or budget-friendly (sometimes all three, like delicious tofu coconut curry). One thing is for sure: if you need meal inspiration, TikTok has millions of options you can try at home.\nWhat will carry over into 2024 With more evidence showing the health benefits of adopting a plant-based diet, we predict this eating pattern is here to stay. Health benefits linked to a plant-based diet include:\nDecreased risk of illness, including cancer\nImproved cardiovascular health\nFewer digestive issues\nTighter weight management\nAnother persuasive argument for more plant-based eating is the high cost of meat and animal products in grocery stores. Beans, tofu, and other plant-based proteins are more affordable (affordability was another 2023 trend), which is essential for consumers feeling the pinch on their grocery bill.\n We also predict people will continue to limit their alcohol intake as they become more invested in managing their health. For a long time, alcohol was a key driver for socializing at parties and events, but people appear to be satisfied with less drinking in their lives. The topic of hydration was hot in 2023 as many people bought massive drinking vessels to stay on top of their water intake (another viral trend on TikTok #watertok). After investing in large portable canisters, people will probably remain mindful of their fluid consumption. We predict this trend will carry forward into the new year.\nNew trends for 2024 Ready for our top guesses for future trends? Obviously, we can’t know what will happen next year, but here are our food predictions for 2024. \n1. Meal prepping Meal prepping is already popular, but more and more people are choosing to cook meals at home to improve their health and stay within their food budget. There are an increasing number of videos online to inspire others to start meal prepping at home, and you can invest in bento box-style lunch boxes or other compact kits. You can start by planning a weekly menu and dedicating an afternoon to cooking two or three meals. Store them in the fridge and enjoy your pre-made meals without dirtying a frying pan all week.\n2. Spice is in A trendy YouTube channel interviews celebrities while eating increasingly spicy foods. We think many people want to explore different types of chili by making chili oils and condiments at home. Popular hot peppers include jalapeño, habanero, cayenne, and Sichuan chili flakes. Most peppers have antioxidants, and adding spice to your foods increases the flavor without relying on a salt shaker. \nIf you’re going to start making products at home, be sure to wash and store your canning tools thoroughly. They need to be 100% sterile to be food-safe.\n3. Functional foods Certain companies, like Olipop, create food products that deliver nutritional advantages. Their product is an example of a functional food (they produce a soda that includes plant fibers, which are digested and serve as prebiotics for your gut). Other functional foods include fortified cereals, grains, eggs, and even soy products to help people increase their nutritional intake from food.\n4. Nostalgia will inspire flavor After fruit roll-ups came back, it’s exciting to think about which other foods from the past will have their moment in 2024. Nostalgic foods extend beyond candies and sweets and include other memorable flavors from the past, such as marzipan, pear, blue raspberry, and ranch. These flavors are popping up in non-alcoholic beverages, including sparkling water and mocktails.\n5. Hormone friendly meals Hormone-driven conditions, such as PCOS, are on the rise. We expect to see more foods and meals on the market catered to these populations, including supplements (always ask your doctor before starting a supplement). You don't need to follow a fancy diet to improve your hormone level, but you should include anti-inflammatory foods to manage symptoms, including berries, omega-3-rich fish (salmon, trout, etc.), dark leafy greens, and other fresh produce. \n6. Homegrown foods Homesteading and growing your own produce may take off next summer. Between at-home grow kits and vertical growing systems (hydroponic plant towers), there are more options than ever to grow food at home, even in small spaces. Growing foods at home also reduces your grocery bill, and it’s rewarding to be self-sustainable.\nWhat’s next?  You can partake in food trends or skip them altogether if they don't appeal to you. At the end of the day, these products (or sometimes behaviors) are meant to be fun and inspiring, and you can choose to participate or not. You certainly don’t need to follow the trends to follow a nutritious and healthy diet. If you’re motivated to make food changes in the new year that support your health goals, you should reach out to your doctor or a dietitian and develop an actionable plan to get closer to your objectives."},{"score":0.1753934621810913,"title":"Your guide to reviewing industry-funded nutrition research","id":"https://mynutriweb.com/reviewing-industry-funded-nutrition-research/","url":"https://mynutriweb.com/reviewing-industry-funded-nutrition-research/","publishedDate":"2024-07-15","author":"MyNutriWeb Editor","text":"By Juliette Kellow \n Registered dietitian and moderator of our Journal Club, Juliette Kellow, reveals her top tips for evaluating the credibility of scientific studies supported by food industry funding, and shares a case study from the Almond Board of California, highlighting how academia and the food industry can work together to expand nutrition knowledge. \n Juliette Kellow is a freelance nutrition consultant and regularly works with sectors of the food industry to support media and PR activities. She has worked with the Almond Board of California on a consultancy basis since 2017 and has been financed by them to write this blog for MyNutriWeb. \n Nutrition research has recently been put under the spotlight – and not just for its role in advancing our knowledge on the relationship between diet and health. Increasingly, there are concerns that some nutrition research funded by the food industry may result in a conflict of interests, potentially leading to bias and bringing the credibility, transparency and trustworthiness of the findings into question. \nFrameworks are increasingly being developed to help researchers negotiate and interact with commercial partners to reduce bias. For example, the Food Research Risk (FoRK) guidance and toolkit from the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge helps researchers evaluate potential interactions with the food industry. Meanwhile, the Institute for the Advancement of Food and Nutrition Sciences (IAFNS) Assembly on Scientific Integrity has updated its Guiding Principles for Funding Food Science and Nutrition Research to help reduce bias and promote integrity in research funded by industry. These types of guidance may play an important part in reducing conflicts of interest in future nutrition research, although it will be up to researchers to decide whether to use them.\nAs health professionals, it’s vital we keep up to date with nutrition research to ensure we give clients current, relevant and evidence-based advice. So, what should we look for when reading existing, newly published or future studies that may not have employed such frameworks? Here are my tips for evaluating the credibility of industry-funded research.\n BEFORE YOU BEGIN \n 1. Understand that funding is needed \nFunding is an essential part of the research process. Undertaking good-quality scientific studies is expensive, so without financial support, research projects wouldn’t happen. Research will nearly always have an external funder – or group of funders. The two main funding pathways are:\nNon-commercial organisations such as charities, national academies, research councils and government health or agriculture departments.\nThe commercial food industry, which encompasses the whole food supply chain, from organisations that support farmers of specific food commodities, such as the Almond Board of California (ABC), to global businesses that manufacture, market and sell food.\n 2. Look for collaborations \nIncreasingly, research is bringing together academia, industry and policymakers. For example, in 2023 the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) with support from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Innovate UK and the Medical Research Council (MRC) set up six new innovation hubs in the UK as part of a new Diet and Health Open Innovation Research Club (OIRC). Such collaborations could bridge the gap between researchers and commercial partners, ensuring all parties have the same objective, report results accurately and work together to improve public health. While there’s no guarantee this will avoid bias, there’s limited evidence to suggest studies with combined funding sources have a lower risk of bias in certain areas, so collaborations could be a step in the right direction.\n 3. Put funding bias into perspective \nFunding bias does exist. In a study looking at published papers in 10 nutrition journals, more than half (55.6%) with industry involvement reported findings favourable to certain food industry interests, compared to less than one in 10 (9.7%) with no industry involvement. But bias doesn’t just result from food industry funding. It exists throughout the entire research process, from the initial concept to getting a paper published and communicating the findings to health agencies, peers, media and consumers. The Catalogue of Bias from the University of Oxford and Centre for Evidence-based Medicine identifies 65 types of bias that can occur throughout the research process, but estimates the complete list of potential entries could be around 250. Industry Sponsorship Bias – defined as ‘a tendency for the methods and results of a study to support the interests of the funding organisation’ – is just one of these. Other examples include:\n Confounding – A distortion that modifies an association between an exposure and an outcome because a factor is independently associated with the exposure and the outcome.\n Hawthorne effect – When individuals modify an aspect of their behaviour in response to their awareness of being observed.\n One-sided reference bias – When authors restrict their references to only those works that support their position.\n Positive results bias – The tendency to submit, accept and publish positive results rather than non-significant or negative results.\n Publication bias – When the likelihood of a study being published is affected by the findings of the study.\n Spin bias – The intentional or unintentional distorted interpretation of research results, unjustifiably suggesting favourable or unfavourable findings that can result in misleading conclusions.\nWhen looking at research, it’s important to understand bias can occur throughout the research process and isn’t always or solely related to funding.\n 4. Recognise your own biases \nOur own biases, based on personal experiences, attitudes, interests and beliefs, have the potential to affect our views on a scientific study. Known as reader bias, this can influence what nutrition research we choose to read and, if we have an opinion on the funding provider, may sway our views on a study before we’ve even read the abstract. Reader bias may be implicit or unconscious, where we’re unaware of our attitudes and beliefs, or explicit, meaning we are aware of these on a conscious level. There’s limited information about reader bias, especially when evaluating nutrition research, but there’s useful (non-nutrition related) information here.\n 5. Look at where the research is published \nIs the publication in a peer-reviewed journal? The peer-review process means research is reviewed by experts who have expertise in the same field but no conflicts of interest with the researchers or funder. This quality control exercise provides an additional layer of review from independent experts to improve quality of papers and screen out poorly conducted studies. Recent years have seen an increase in online journals that don’t carry out peer reviews before publication – sometimes known as predatory publishing – so checking this is important before evaluating a paper.\n 6. Look for pre-registration status \nPapers reporting results of clinical intervention studies should state whether the research was registered with an official body such as clinicaltrials.gov before the study began. Pre-registration sets out the research plan, including the hypothesis, primary and secondary outcome measures, the methodologies and analyses to be used. This helps to stop them being changed during the research process or at publication to benefit the funder or the researcher. Plus, if researchers have stated what they want to measure, but then don’t find any significant differences in primary outcomes, they must still report them.\n EVALUATING THE RESEARCH \n 7. Consider whether the research is needed \nLook at the rationale for undertaking the research and consider:\nIs the research justified?\nIs it important or necessary to progress knowledge in a specific area?\nIs it in the best interests of public health?\nWill it only benefit the organisation funding the research?\n 8. Identify the source of funding \nResearch papers should identify where funding has come from and any role the funder plays in the design of the study – regardless of whether it’s from industry, a charity, government or a research council – and report any conflicts of interest.\n 9. Check out the authors \nLook at who the authors are, where they work, and whether they report any conflicts of interest. This will identify whether researchers from a funding body have been involved in the development of the study. Increasingly, research papers outline the roles of individual authors at various stages of the study, for example, ‘author x extracted the data’, ‘author y analysed the data’, ‘all authors contributed to the writing of the article and the study design’.\n 10. Consider the study design \nAsk yourself:\nDoes the study design make sense and address the research question?\nIs it fit for purpose and robust?\nFor interventional studies, does the control group provide an appropriate comparison to the intervention?\nHave potential confounders been addressed?\nDid many people drop out of the study and, if so, why?\nWas the analysis done blindly, so interpretation of the results wasn’t swayed?\n 11. Review the results, limitations and conclusion \nWhen it comes to looking at research findings:\nCheck results are accurately reported and supported by the data.\nMake sure primary outcomes aren’t overlooked in favour of secondary outcomes that may have greater benefits for funders.\nConsider whether the findings are clinically relevant – research papers may reveal a significant result but consider whether this would make a difference in clinical practice.\nConsider whether the results are what would be expected based on current and existing literature in the area. Research can be ground-breaking, so don’t automatically dismiss findings that don’t sit neatly within the current literature. But do question whether they could be caused by bias if they deviate from current thinking, especially in a direction that benefits funders.\nReflect on whether findings will have a positive or negative impact on public health.\nIdentify what you think the limitations could be and see if the paper communicates them properly.\nCheck the conclusion is supported by the main study findings.\n 12. Consider how research findings are publicised \nIf you have access to press releases, look at how research is reported by the academic institute or funding bodies. Does this reflect what was actually found in the research? A recent paper looking at the science communication of nutrition and dietetic research found funders, journals and researchers’ institutions often exaggerate when reporting on study findings, for example, inferring health benefits in humans from a lab study.\n 13. Making your mind up \nDeciding whether industry funding has influenced nutrition research is often down to individual interpretation. There are positive steps being taken to reduce bias, thanks to greater scrutiny and awareness of the issue, and because affiliations with industry and conflicts of interest are required to be disclosed in most situations, aiding transparency. Together with having a greater understanding of what to look for when evaluating nutrition research, all these factors can help us decide on the credibility of industry-funded studies.\n Case Study: The Industry Perspective \n \nThe Almond Board of California (ABC) has 30+ years’ experience of funding research. To date there are more than 200 published studies that support the benefits of eating almonds for heart health, weight management, satiety, type 2 diabetes, gut health, skin health, physical activity and more.\nWe talked to Elena Hemler, Associate Director, Nutrition Research for the Almond Board of California, to learn about ABC’s approach to funding nutrition research.\n Why does the Almond Board of California fund research?\nResearch is a core part of ABC’s work. As a non-profit Federal Marketing Order overseen by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and funded by almond farmers and processors, ABC promotes California almonds by funding studies about almonds’ health benefits, as well as ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and food safety. The Almond Board of California’s research has helped advance understanding of almonds’ health benefits related to heart health, diabetes, weight management and more.\nIndustry-funded studies have been pivotal in contributing to current knowledge about healthy dietary patterns. From 1980-2000, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommended that people “avoid too much fat,” or “choose a diet low in fat.” It was research, some funded by ABC, which led to the current understanding that different types of fats have different health effects. These findings have had dramatic impacts on the changing guidance on fat – which now acknowledges the crucial role of unsaturated fats (like the monounsaturated fats abundant in almonds) in improving health and encourages replacement of saturated fat with unsaturated fat.\n How does the Almond Board of California pay for research? \nAlmond farmers and processors fund the Almond Board of California each year based on the quantity of almonds grown, and part of this budget is used to support nutrition research. Research projects may be exclusively funded by the Almond Board of California or partly funded by other organisations, such as government bodies like the U.S Department of Agriculture.\n What kind of research do you fund? \nWe fund research in many areas, including sustainable agricultural practices, soil health, pollination and bee health, food quality and safety, and, of course, nutrition science. We prioritise transparency and high quality research and work with top reputable researchers at leading academic institutions. We take great pride in the calibre and strength of the nutrition research we fund, and always disclose when we have funded research.\n Where do research ideas come from? \nABC periodically releases requests for proposals inviting researchers to submit their research ideas. We purposely keep our requests for proposals general as we don’t want to limit ideas, set the research agenda, or move researchers in a certain direction. Once received, we send research proposals for peer review by independent scientists who are experts in the proposal topic area to ensure the scientific methodology outlined is robust. Proposals are then reviewed by the Almond Board’s Nutrition Research Committee, made up of volunteers including almond growers and scientists, who determine which proposals to support.\nABC’s Nutrition Research Committee identifies broad areas we are keen to explore and where there is potential for almonds to benefit health. For example, in the last few years there’s been an interest in learning more about the role almonds may play in improving skin health, prediabetes, gut health, and exercise performance and recovery.\n What is the role of the Almond Board of California during the research process? \nOnce a research study is funded, the researchers work independently on the project design and implementation. ABC is not involved in study design, data collection, analysis or results interpretation. Researchers are required to give progress reports at different stages of the project, such as if participant recruitment is on schedule, but are not asked about results. ABC requires researchers to submit their findings to a peer-reviewed journal, regardless of the results of the studies.\n How does the Almond Board of California communicate its research findings? \nEverything ABC says publicly about research results is reviewed by USDA to ensure study findings are put in the correct context and not distorted, oversimplified, or generalised beyond the population that is being investigated. When sharing the findings, we always disclose the funding source and focus on how this research will benefit the health of consumers and how they can action it. As well as writing media releases for consumer and health press, we communicate new research to the scientific and healthcare professional community through our Nutrition Bulletin newsletter, website, online roundtables and at scientific conferences..\nIn all communications, we provide detail on the study design, subjects, full results, conclusions, and limitations. Plus, we stick to reporting on what the study found without making assumptions or exaggerating the results.\n What research has the Almond Board of California recently funded? \nRecent research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, led by Professor Kevin Whelan from King’s College London, set out to determine the impact of whole almonds and ground almonds on the composition of gut microbiota, gut microbiota diversity and gut transit time. In the study, 87 healthy adults consumed either 56g whole almonds, 56g ground almonds or an energy-matched muffin for four weeks. While there were no significant differences in transit time or the composition or diversity of gut microbiota, the researchers found almond consumption significantly increased stool output (a sign of a well-functioning gastrointestinal system). When pooling results for whole and ground almonds, researchers saw increased levels of butyrate, a beneficial short chain fatty acid that’s been linked to fighting inflammation and lowering the risk of colon cancer. These findings suggest almonds could have a role to play in supporting gut health and provide a foundation for future studies.\nAnother study published in Clinical Nutrition ESPEN, led by Dr. Anoop Misra, Professor and Chairman of Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases, and Endocrinology in New Delhi, found that eating almonds before breakfast, lunch and dinner was able to reverse prediabetes among one quarter of research participants. In the study, 30 Asian Indian adults with prediabetes and overweight or obesity, consumed 20g almonds before breakfast, lunch and dinner each day for three months. Compared with a control group, almond eaters had statistically significant reductions in body weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, HbA1c and total cholesterol. Furthermore, almost one in four participants in the intervention group (23.3%) saw raised blood glucose return to a normal level, suggesting that eating almonds before meals has potential for reversing prediabetes.\n Disclaimer: This blog has been written in collaboration with the Almond Board of California nutrition team.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer’s best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements’ health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market’s growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market.

These purchases give companies a deeper presence in certain categories without saddling their businesses with huge amounts of debt or the complexities of integrating a new business. \nExecutives attending the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Florida last month said smaller transactions are likely to remain popular, and they are poised to strike if the right deal comes along.\nDirk Van de Put, CEO of , told Wall Street analysts.\n \nThe past few years have seen food makers engage in a handful of billion-plus deals, but in nearly every case it has been with a single company or brand that fills a void within their already burgeoning portfolios.\nLast year, jam and peanut giant J.M.

The supplier, once famous for sugar, spun-off its sugar business in 2010, and continues to invest in sugar reduction technologies. Tate &amp; Lyle has recently acquired CP Kelco, a US-based company that manufactures ‘nature-based' speciality ingredients, for $1.8bn (approx. €1.6bn). The company sells ingredients such as pectin, a fibre found in fruit and vegetables, and citrus fibre, which is sourced from citrus peels and is, the company claims, 'clean label'.  A reaction to health and ingredients concerns?​ Consumers are increasingly concerned about the prevalence of long ingredients lists in food. So-called clean label products are, thus, highly sought after. “We are finding that consumers are paying much more attention to ingredients on product labels. Increasingly, they want ingredients which they perceive to be ‘clean,’ ‘natural’ and recognisable and they also want simpler labels with a lesser number of ingredients,” a CP Kelco spokesperson told FoodNavigator. CP Kelco’s ingredients, the company claims, are ‘nature-based'. Health is also a key factor for consumers, and has driven many trends over the past few years. This has driven trends such as the continuing demand for sugar reduction​. According to research by Pitchbook and Tate &amp; Lyle itself, the market for speciality food ingredients has grown three-fold between 2015 and 2022, driven by demand for clean label and healthy ingredients.  Clean-label meat alternatives  Plant-based meat alternatives often have long ingredients lists containing products consumers have never heard of. Some plant-based alternatives are bucking the trend, however. For example, Spanish start-up Heura​ is producing clean-label alternatives for meat such as chicken and ham. Vegbloc​, on the other hand, is producing a clean-label substitute that doesn’t try to mimic any specific meat, but simply takes its place in a meal. CP Kelco provides ingredients, including pectin and citrus fibre, for meat alternatives.   According to Tate &amp; Lyle, the global speciality ingredients market was valued at $75bn (approx. €69bn) in 2022, and the European market is 22% ahead of the global one. It is expected to grow by 6% on a compound annual basis. Tate &amp; Lyle aims to develop a healthier portfolio with the acquisition, aiming to present a healthier image to consumers. “Pectin is a key ingredient in many clean label solutions, while CP Kelco’s highly functional speciality gums are frequently used by customers to tackle gelling, thickening and stabilization challenges. Citrus fibre, one of its newer clean label ingredients, is used to add nutrition to an increasing number of consumer products,” Tate &amp; Lyle’s CEO Nick Hampton told FoodNavigator.  How will the acquisition change the business?​ With the businesses combined, Tate &amp; Lyle’s Hampton told FoodNavigator CP Kelco’s ingredients will be able to be used in a range of new applications. “As a combined business, we will be able to provide a sweetener solution, with pectin/gum providing mouthfeel to replace the mouthfeel of sugar, coating the tongue. Take a Chipotle dipping sauce – before we could thicken with starch. Once we have combined, we will, with xanthan gum, be able to stabilise the sauce, as well as thicken with starch,” he told us.  The two companies have worked together extensively on previous occasions. The acquisition will bring this partnership closer still."},{"score":0.1589525192975998,"title":"Mars to buy healthy food maker Kevin's Natural Foods","id":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/mars-buy-healthy-food-maker-kevins-natural-foods-2023-07-05/","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/mars-buy-healthy-food-maker-kevins-natural-foods-2023-07-05/","publishedDate":"2023-07-05","author":"Anirban Sen; Abigail Summerville","text":"NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Family-owned food giant Mars Inc on Wednesday agreed to buy Kevin's Natural Foods, which is known for its sous-vide meals, sauces, and side dishes, the companies said. The deal values private equity-backed Kevin's at nearly $800 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Kevin's started exploring options, which included a sale of the company, earlier this year. McLean, Virginia-based Mars, which generates about $48 billion in annual sales, has three major businesses - Mars Petcare, Mars Snacking, and Mars Food &amp; Nutrition. After the deal is completed, Kevin's will operate as a standalone brand under the food and nutrition unit. In petcare, Mars operates brands like Pedigree, Whiskas, and Royal Canin, and it recently expanded its footprint in the sector through the acquisition of veterinary equipment firm Heska Corp. Mars, widely known as the maker of candy brands like M&amp;M's and Snickers, has made a series of acquisitions in recent years as part of its efforts to diversify and build out its categories focused on healthy foods and snacking. Mars plans to grow its food business through more potential acquisitions in the near term, said Shaid Shah, global president at Mars Food &amp; Nutrition. \"We are trying to deliver on a mission we have to enable healthier and more flavorful diets for consumers worldwide, while Kevin's is trying to empower the busiest people to eat clean without sacrificing flavors,\" Shah said in an interview. \"What really inspired us about Kevin's was their purpose and their passion for food,\" he added. Modesto, California-based Kevin's, which counted private equity firms TowerBrook Capital Partners and NewRoad Capital Partners among its backers, was co-founded in 2019 by Dan Costa, Kelsie Costa-Olson, and Kevin McCray. TowerBrook and NewRoad are selling their stake in Kevin's as part of the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. McCray launched Kevin's after he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, as he wanted to build a food brand that focused on healthy diets. \"Joining the Mars Food &amp; Nutrition portfolio of brands will allow us to accelerate the development of more product innovations and support our mission of bringing Kevin’s to more consumers across markets,\" McCray said. The food and beverage sector has been a relatively bright spot for dealmaking in recent quarters, even as overall consumer deal volumes remain muted. Unilever (ULVR.L) last month said it would buy frozen yogurt brand Yasso in North America, while Flagstone Foods acquired Emerald Nuts from Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) in May. Citi served as financial adviser and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, Covington &amp; Burling and ArentFox Schiff acted as legal advisers to Mars. Wells Fargo Securities and Sheppard Mullin advised Kevin's.

Christin Miller, director of strategic communications at Bayer, said that “ceasing further investment in Care/of will allow Bayer to better invest in future innovations that help people manage their personal health. This includes investing in our current portfolio of brands to deliver innovation to our consumers and customers.” On Monday, Care/of customers received an email from company co-founder and CEO Craig Elbert that it would stop accepting supplement orders​, offering customers a multi-month purchase at a 40% discount until June 7. “We are so grateful for the support of our customers over the years and appreciate your understanding” and “we have been working through potential options for the brand,” Elbert wrote. Speaking off the record, a source close to Care/of told us that Elbert is being upfront about future possibilities for the company and that current negotiations with outside parties are underway.  A meteoric rise​ Elbert and co-founder Akash Shah created Care/of in 2016 with a goal of tailoring the right vitamins and supplements options for consumers through individualized supplement packs after customers complete a 5-minute health questionnaire. Care/of was among the first companies to implement tailored supplement products, gaining insight and data from users. It got noticed. Nearly two years after it launched, Care/of had raised $46 million​ in funding. That dollar amount would quadruple by 2020, when Bayer bought majority stake (70%) in the privately held company for $225 million. Care/of joined the Bayer’s Consumer Health, North America portfolio. However, Bayer began to have financial concerns within that period. Despite company revenues topping nearly $52 billion in 2023, Bayer earnings declined from the previous year. Additionally, the company eliminated 1,500 jobs in the first quarter of 2024 as part of the CEO’s new operating​ plan. Since it acquired chemical giant Monsanto in 2018, Bayer is also grappling with ongoing litigation about whether the subsidiary’s weed control product Roundup causes cancer. Bayer spent approximately $11 billion​ to settle Roundup lawsuits in 2020 alone. The unnamed source who spoke to NutraIngredients-USA said Bayer’s financial situation may be challenging but that its consumer health division is profitable. However, they acknowledged that revenue was down for Care/of.   The differentiation argument​ In 2021, Care/of established retail relationships with brick-and mortar retailers, including Target. Its supplements were priced at $15 to $19, comparable and competitive to other companies, sources said. Despite the price comparison, Joshua Anthony, founder and CEO of Nlumn, a personalized nutrition consultancy, said that getting a personalized nutrition message across on a website is different than on a store shelf. “Just this idea of market expansion without necessarily a clear point of difference may have been a real issue for them,” Anthony said. “They do a nice job of having a clean label, but they don't necessarily do a great job of communicating a differentiated benefit.” What does differentiate Care/of from other brands is its 5-minute survey, Anthony said with a caveat. More and more companies are using diagnostic tests, whether that’s stool samples or blood tests, to give consumers precise measurements about their health status and what supplements to take, he added. NutraIngredients-USA’s source close to Care/of said it was, in fact, the 5-minute questionnaire that offered consumers a clear difference because not everyone wants or has the time for invasive information to be gathered about them every three months. “Yes, it’s hard to compete, but this industry is growing, and there’s multiple ways to do [personalized nutrition],” the source said. “The macro picture is that disease care is expensive. Pharmaceutical giants are investing in the massive self-care industry. It’s a huge trend when it comes to cost, and younger generations are more interested in health and wellness than previous generations.”"},{"score":0.17546851933002472,"title":"M&A in 2023 and Trends for 2024 | Morrison Foerster","id":"https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/240104-m-a-in-2023-and-trends-for-2024","url":"https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/240104-m-a-in-2023-and-trends-for-2024","publishedDate":"2024-01-04","author":"","text":"M&amp;A activity in 2023 was subdued, as dealmakers grappled with geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates, and increasing regulatory scrutiny, against a backdrop of general economic uncertainty. Challenges in the U.S. banking sector in the early part of the year also took their toll. But deals got done. While the total value of deals fell by about 23%,  to the lowest level since 2013, the number of deals fell by 16%, reflecting a focus on smaller deals. Some sectors stood out: tech, while down from prior years, continued its strong run, as artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies created market buzz, and oil and gas in Q4 edged out tech, by value, for the first time in recent memory, thanks in part to two blockbuster transactions. In Q4 the M&amp;A market showed some signs of recovery. Big-ticket ($2BN+) deals hit their highest levels since Q2 2022, and five of the year’s 10 largest global deals were announced. Further clarity on, if not resolution of, some of 2023’s challenges may lift M&amp;A in 2024 as companies seek to implement growth, earnings, and valuation strategies. In this alert, we review the M&amp;A markets in 2023 and the major legal and regulatory trends affecting deals in 2024.     Global Activity Global activity through December 15 reached $2.9 trillion in value, down 23% year-over-year.   North America – North America deals totaled $1.46 trillion, down 12% from 2022. The second half of the year saw promising activity, with several megadeals announced in September and October, including Cisco’s agreement to acquire Splunk, Exxon’s agreement to acquire Pioneer, and Chevron’s agreement to acquire Hess. U.S. capital markets were buoyed in September by Arm’s $5 billion debut on Nasdaq (in which MoFo represented Arm), the largest IPO since 2021.  Asia-Pacific – Asia-Pacific deals totaled $708.2 billion, a 26% year-over-year decline. Among other things, cross-border activity between China and the U.S. continued to stall. Japan was a bright spot, with the number of deals up 34% compared to 2022. Healthcare M&amp;A in APAC saw its highest value level ever, and auto industry M&amp;A was up 80% year-over-year.  Europe – EMEA saw $676 billion in deal activity, a 35% drop compared to 2022. U.S. companies led the most in-bound acquisitions, with deals valued at $89 billion. Much like the global M&amp;A market, the number of EMEA deals saw a notable increase in Q4, up 13% compared with Q3.   Tech – Tech remained a top choice for dealmakers, accounting for 27% of deal value. In our 2023 Tech M&amp;A Survey, dealmakers picked cybersecurity as the most promising subsector for deals over the next 12 months, with the AI sector also presenting strong dealmaking opportunities.  Healthcare – Healthcare continued to perform. In North America, healthcare was the third-highest sector by volume, led by several large M&amp;A transactions, including Pfizer’s $43 billion takeover of Seagen. As noted above, healthcare M&amp;A in APAC saw its highest value level ever, led in part by Daiichi Sankyo’s $22 billion deal with Merck.  Private Equity – Sponsors took a cautious approach to M&amp;A, with global private equity deals dropping 33% in volume and 41% in value year-over-year.

From the pandemic-fueled rout in 2020 to 2021’s record-breaking recovery, followed by a steep decline in 2023, the global M&amp;A market has offered something of a masterclass in volatility.\nToughened by these swings and successive macroeconomic, geopolitical, and regulatory challenges, many dealmakers are approaching the year ahead not with trepidation, but with a healthy dose of optimism. Yes, they just weathered an exceedingly difficult year for dealmaking. And yes, few can remember a time that was more challenging for M&amp;A.\nFor all of 2023, global M&amp;A activity dropped 16 percent from a year earlier, to $3.1 trillion. This contrasts with other market benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500, which climbed 24 percent last year on the wings of a handful of technology- and AI-driven stocks. A longer-term view shows the depth of M&amp;A’s trough in 2023. For example, in the US, the world’s busiest M&amp;A market, activity dropped to its lowest proportion of S&amp;P 500 market value in 20 years.\nWith curves like that, we were not surprised to hear a provocative question at a recent conference: “Is M&amp;A dead?” \nOur answer is: certainly not.\n  Explore the full collection of articles from our Top M&amp;A trends in 2024 report &gt;  \nM&amp;A market durability\nA variety of factors supports the global M&amp;A market’s durability. First, with the business landscape experiencing seismic shifts—ranging from the rise of AI to the growing importance of sustainability and the emergence of a more demanding, tech-enabled consumer class—CEOs across industries tell us that M&amp;A is a more vital strategic lever than ever. Organic growth—which never compared well with the most effective M&amp;A strategy—pales further when significant strategic shifts are called for. This is especially true when companies need to adapt quickly.\n  A jump in activity in the fourth quarter (of 2023) points to increasing optimism returning to the market.  \nFor example, our latest analysis of the “Global 2,000”—the world’s largest global public companies—found that those making more than two small to midsized deals annually over ten years through 2022 delivered a median excess total shareholder return (TSR) of 2.3 percent. This programmatic approach outperformed all other M&amp;A strategies, including organic growth, which actually destroyed value in the same period. Part of this success stems from actively managing portfolios. Programmatic acquirers are not just acquisitive; they also actively divest nonstrategic assets. In a McKinsey global survey on M&amp;A, respondents from programmatic acquirers were more likely than others to say their organizations conducted divestitures in the past five years.\nStrikingly, programmatic dealmakers with the most deals earned the highest returns. Seventy percent outperformed programmatic peers who made fewer deals. And the performance gap between programmatic acquirers and companies pursuing organic growth only widened during the COVID-19 years. Programmatic acquirers achieved 3.9 percent excess TSR in the past decade, up from 2.9 percent in the 2010s. Even with some of the lowest M&amp;A volumes in recent years, our latest research shows that the case for programmatic M&amp;A is stronger than ever (see “The seven habits of programmatic acquirers”).\nCash is another important source of ballast. Unlike past markets, when private equity and principal investors drove much global M&amp;A activity, in 2023 they fled to the sidelines, slashing their activity 37 percent to $560 billion, as they were spooked by high costs of capital, uncertainty about central bankers’ plans, and regulators’ more robust scrutiny of deals. (Indeed, the validity of this last source of uncertainty has been confirmed by the lengthening regulatory review process, which has extended on average by about 35 percent over ten years, through 2022, for the 100 largest global deals annually. Further, the proportion of companies undergoing long-term investigations in Europe and the US increased about 50 percent from 2017 to 2022.)\nBut private equity (PE) investors may not be so rare in the times ahead. Although they accounted for only 18 percent of deal activity in 2023, they are not likely to linger on the sidelines for long. Some funds will need to consider exit strategies and redeployments in the near term, and others, along with corporate dealmakers, may be aroused by the more than $2 trillion in undeployed capital as of the end of 2023. Although macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges could continue to temper PE interest, that mountain of dry powder nonetheless beckons—a temptation that will grow for PE investors and other dealmakers as they sense a return to greater market stability.\nWhile we live in dynamic times, several factors point to a more favorable macroeconomic environment at this writing.\nHigher interest rates have tempered the inflationary trends so worrying to central bankers; inflation now hovers just above 3 percent across the US, Europe, and Asia. Job growth has remained healthy, with US unemployment under 4 percent late last year, while the Eurozone hit historic lows of around 6.5 percent. Consumer spending has also remained robust globally, with US retail sales rising at an annual rate of about 4 percent from a year earlier. This improving picture has buoyed economists’ hopes of a soft landing for the US economy—a sentiment shared by many investors who boosted stock market returns at the end of the year.\nAlthough inflation fears have been receding, concern about geopolitical instability is on the rise. For example, late last year, 67 percent of respondents to a McKinsey survey cited geopolitical concerns as the top threat to global economic growth in 2024—the largest share identifying this as a top risk since shortly after the war in Ukraine began. Concerns about political transitions also emerged as a top risk to global economic growth.\nThese nearly 1,000 survey participants from a broad range of regions and industries remained largely positive about their own economies, with 46 percent expecting conditions in their home economies to improve in the next six months, and only 26 percent expecting them to worsen. But as the media remained riveted by wars and fractious political conditions in some countries, respondents’ optimism about the global economy and their companies’ workforce growth and profits ebbed a bit (see “Economic conditions outlook during turbulent times”).\nAnalysts, meanwhile, are more sanguine about corporate prospects for 2024. We ended the year with analyst consensus of about 5 percent growth in revenue for the year ahead, with gains in EBITDA and net earnings of around 8 to 9 percent—a bounty that will not land evenly across industries, they believe (see “Who drove the returns in 2023?”).\nWhat we can learn from 2023 M&amp;A market performance\nThe performance of various sectors and regions may indicate which areas of M&amp;A are likely to recover most quickly from the global M&amp;A market’s ten-year low in 2023—a decline that followed eight years of mostly stable activity (Exhibit 1).\n \nFor all of 2023, global M&amp;A value fell 16 percent to $3.1 trillion—a showing even weaker than the pandemic year of 2020. While the average deal size increased 14 percent, owing to a handful of large deals, the number of companies changing hands fell 27 percent from a year earlier.\nWith macroeconomic, geopolitical, and regulatory pressures all curbing exuberance, megadeals (over $10 billion) fell 17 percent to $705 billion, but maintained their 23 percent share of global deal activity.\nThe Americas, buoyed by surprisingly strong economic growth and employment figures, remained the most active market for M&amp;A—accounting for more than half of global activity in 2023. Deal value fell 7 percent to $1.6 trillion, a decline that was softened by the activity of programmatic acquirers and a handful of megadeals. Taken together, the value of deals in the Americas for all of 2023 only slightly trails the pandemic-era 2020 total of $1.7 trillion.\nAlso boosting activity in the Americas was dealmakers’ continuing propensity for large deals, as the region claimed 11 of the world’s 20 largest deals announced in 2023. Indeed, average deal size jumped 38 percent in the region, to approximately $670 million, even as the number of deals in the Americas fell 32 percent.\nM&amp;A markets in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA) had a far rougher 2023, experiencing greater challenges from macroeconomic impacts, as well as geopolitical conflict and volatile energy costs. The value of M&amp;A activity in EMEA fell 30 percent to $721 billion in 2023, while deal volume dropped 29 percent. Average deal size remained stable at approximately $400 million.\nMeanwhile, the value of M&amp;A transactions in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region fell 19 percent to its lowest level in a decade, $734 billion, but more acquirers outside the region found appealing targets there—especially in fast-growing economies and countries with relatively low geopolitical risk, such as India. The region overall had net-positive deal inflow for the first time in five years. Japan was a particular bright spot, with activity jumping 49 percent, for example. Greater China drove only about 40 percent of overall deal value—its lowest share in five years. Four industries accounted for about two-thirds of dealmaking value in the region: energy and materials; advanced industries; tech, media and telecom; and financial services. Despite the complexities of vastly different business environments across the region, APAC continues to account for about a quarter of global deal value, up from just 15 percent 20 years ago.\nWe expect robust dealmaking in APAC in the years to come as multinationals headquartered in slower-growing regions look for opportunities to scale up, consolidate operations, diversify, and advance decarbonization and sustainability initiatives. A World Data Lab report projects that Asia will be home to more than 80 percent of the world’s “new consumers” in 2024—tens of millions of people who can afford to spend $12 or more per day for the first time. Brookings points out that the consuming class will outnumber the vulnerable and poor in the region for the first time in history.\nIndustry sectors also had varied experiences. Having closed a series of behemoth deals that long kept technology, media, and telecom (TMT) companies in top place as the most active dealmakers, TMT passed that baton in 2023. The GEM sector (Global Energy and Materials) has now become the newest fulcrum of M&amp;A activity globally, claiming 26 percent of transaction value as companies sought to grow core businesses or diversify into adjacencies—signaling their continued faith in fossil fuels (Exhibit 2).\n \nAnd in a departure from recent years, when PE dealmaking accounted for well over 20 percent of global activity, the dominance of corporate dealmaking grew in 2023 to 82 percent of deal value globally, even as corporate-led value fell 10 percent.\nAs top executives continued to evolve their strategies through M&amp;A, they kept their focus close to home. Domestic deals remained dominant, delivering 72 percent of deal value. However, the proportion of cross-regional deal activity increased—up four percentage points to 17 percent in 2023—as pandemic-era fears continued to recede (Exhibit 3).\n \nLooking ahead\nWhile the timing of a full-throttle M&amp;A market recovery is not entirely clear, global M&amp;A activity gathered steam toward the end of 2023, supporting many leaders’ view that opportunities would open up precipitously (Exhibit 4).\n \nThe value of global M&amp;A activity jumped 41 percent in last year’s fourth quarter from the third quarter, and 37 percent from a year earlier, to $1 trillion. The number of companies changing hands also increased 7 percent from the third quarter. With many dealmakers regaining a sense of exuberance, average deal size jumped 32 percent from the third quarter, to $550 million.\nAll regions participated in the M&amp;A market’s fourth-quarter surge. The value of companies changing hands in the Americas jumped 39 percent from the third quarter, while the average deal size grew 47 percent.\nEMEA had an even stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, with the value of deal activity increasing 60 percent from the third quarter, while average deal size jumped 63 percent.\nOnly numbers like these could make APAC’s improvement appear somewhat muted. The value of APAC M&amp;A activity increased 29 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, and 15 percent from a year earlier. APAC was the only region with an increase in the number of transactions.\nHow to prepare\nIn anticipation of a market upturn, many leading CEOs across industries and regions are grooming their M&amp;A teams—and their boards—to be ready to leap. Companies are addressing regional and industry shifts with dealmaking aimed at enhancing or reshaping businesses. In addition to acquisitions (increasingly structured in ways to mitigate risk), transactions often include divestitures and a variety of partnerships. Leading transactors are also prioritizing actions aimed at achieving superior performance in M&amp;A, with the most effective dealmakers finding many ways to stack the deck in their favor.\nTo get ready for what could be a wave of transactions in 2024, companies can take important steps now:\nRe-evaluate M&amp;A themes and update strategy, invest in capabilities and assets that will effectively evolve the portfolio, and consider divestitures as actively as acquisitions.\nShift M&amp;A themes to mitigate increased geopolitical risks—for example, by emphasizing localization rather than geographic expansion, targeting sectors with stronger market outlooks, investing in vertical integration, and strengthening supply chain resiliency.\nEstablish a higher bar for value creation to offset higher costs of capital, and think broadly about different kinds of synergies—not just cost or revenue-bound but also capex; not only combinational, but also transformational synergies.\nPursue partnerships and alternative deal structures—such as JVs, alliances, and public market buyouts—to offset the reduced availability of debt financing.\nUse alternative structures to reduce transaction risks, such as milestone payments.\nIn this collection of articles, we offer in-depth discussions on trends and best practices to help you navigate the global M&amp;A environment in 2024. We offer perspectives on some of the critical issues likely to influence performance in a variety of sectors as well as insights on issues of central importance to leaders.\n                  The following people were instrumental in helping to create this report: Hameed Allapitchai, Roerich Bansal, Charles Barthold, Matteo Camera, Virginia Casas, Oliver Engert, Brian Grandfield, Susan Gurewitsch, Benjamin Houssard, Kameron Kordestani, Paul Kuderli, Margaret Loeb, Paul Morgan, James Newman, Lynette Nguyen, Emily O’Loughlin, Steve Sakson, Anne Schultz, Rui Silva, Rodrigo Sletatt, Howard Tomb, Fiona Villalobos.

Consulting, baby boomers are the most frequent users of vitamins &amp; dietary supplements (VDS), with 50% indicating they take at least one supplement a day.  L.E.K.’s report also states that Millennials have the highest average annual monthly VDS spend ($70 per month), according to their recent survey. Younger generations have also had the fastest-growing weekly median earnings compared to older cohorts (ages 45+) from 2016 to 2022, demonstrating their increasing purchasing power and making them an attractive target VDS consumer.1 \nThere are two takeaways from this information. First, these are two strong segments to target to increase your VDS sales and each will require different strategies. Second, if you don’t have a large base of Millenials as customers, it is worth an investment of time and energy to attract these shoppers to your store.\nTo address your more mature demographic of VDS shoppers, consider the following options.\nCheck your POS sales reports to determine which VDS products are currently popular among your customers.\nCross-reference the most popular regimen prescriptions taken by your customers to determine if there are missed opportunities. Are there supplements that aren’t selling as well but could address side effects of popular prescriptions? Are there additional supplements that could help the wellbeing of these patients that you can bring to their attention?\nHost a coffee hour to answer questions, make recommendations, and educate this group about the various vitamin and supplements you carry in store or can order for next day delivery.\nTo capitalize on or attract the younger generation of VDS shoppers, try to engage them on social platforms to understand their buying habits and preferred product types. Facebook polls may be an option to use to get to this information, but if you don’t have a base of Millenial customers already following your Facebook page, you may have to get creative. Consider hosting an open house or offering educational seminars with other local healthcare professionals or facilities, or other wellness businesses, such as yoga studios or gyms. Partnering allows you access to the partnering business’s customers and makes promotion costs more manageable.\nFor both demographic groups, a loyalty/reward program is a good idea to keep customers coming back to your store for their ongoing VDS purchases. If you have the resources available, set up a subscription program for VDS purchases since, in most cases, these are ongoing, repeatable sales."},{"score":0.16410261392593384,"title":"What To Know About the Supplement Category Going Into 2024","id":"https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/wellness/supplement-category-update-1235923485/","url":"https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/wellness/supplement-category-update-1235923485/","publishedDate":"2023-12-08","author":"Emily Burns","text":"Stocking up on immunity gummies to ward off COVID-19 may be a thing of the past, but the supplement market overall is stronger than ever. \nFrom sleep-improving tinctures to gut-healthy gummies, Americans are turning to vitamins, minerals and supplements to proactively improve their health and well-being.\n“The market has rallied back and it’s showing strong growth,” said Jostein Solheim, chief executive officer of Unilever’s health and well-being division. “It has sustained because people’s interest in their health and in seeking out solutions that support their health goals has just increased.”\n \nRelated Articles\nNielsen IQ identifies four categories within the wellness industry, including home scents, personal health, functional beverages and supplements, which are outpacing other verticals in terms of sales. The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. “Our consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they’re more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,” said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood — the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body’s total serotonin. \n“People now understand the gut’s connected to everything,” said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be “probiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.” \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual’s founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company’s most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n“We’re always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer’s] needs and what’s top of mind for them,” Schneider said. “First is gut health. That’s the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they’re stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.” \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. “This is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,” said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature’s Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n“We see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,” Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient’s popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep “a very high priority” and it is the “greatest unmet consumer need.” \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n“Two thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,” said Schneider. \n Ritual’s Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual’s Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice’s founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n“Unique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,” said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. “Unique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.”\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n“[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It’s all over TikTok,” said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand’s Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. “Magnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.” \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n“Dehydration is such a fundamental challenge…75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],” said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. “Pills are really easy, but we still don’t take them,” said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n“There are many who suffer from pill fatigue…They want things that they look forward to taking,” Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper’s Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray’s supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth’s, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apothékary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers “expect product labels to be more specific and transparent,” as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n“The category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,” said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. “Because of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,” said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. “That allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.” \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there’s room for more. “There’s a lot of opportunity for innovation. It’s definitely not saturated,” said Solheim, citing women’s health as a key area for growth. “The addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.”"},{"score":0.16111914813518524,"title":"Vitamins and Supplements recent news | New Hope","id":"https://www.newhope.com/natural-product-trends/vitamins-and-supplements","url":"https://www.newhope.com/natural-product-trends/vitamins-and-supplements","publishedDate":"2023-12-27","author":"","text":"New Hope Network is part of the Informa Markets Division of Informa PLC   Informa PLC ABOUT US INVESTOR RELATIONS TALENT    This site is operated by a business or businesses owned by Informa PLC and all copyright resides with them.

One of the fields that is heavily affected by advances in big data is the manufacturing industry.   Developing Analytics-Driven Marketing Approaches to Private Label Supplement Manufacturing Development of Individual Supplement Formulations Packaging and Branding Strategies for Supplements Private Label vs. Branded Supplements: Key Differences Growth Trends and Popular Private Label Supplement Products Big Data Technology is Radically Changing the Supplement Label Manufacturing Sector   We have talked at length about some of the ways that manufacturers are using big data and AI to improve the trajectory of their industry. For example, many manufacturers are using AI to create augmented reality to make things easier to process. Private label supplement manufacturers, in particular, are using AI to help automate many of these processes. The health and beauty industry is astonishing in its growth rate. It seems that no one can do without dietary supplements these days, and each year, the industry demonstrates more signs of development. The increasing importance of preventive health and awareness of a healthy lifestyle have contributed to this growth. Consequently, new products and brands are emerging in the market, often thanks to private label supplement manufacturing. To create and release a product that will appeal to the audience and become their daily choice takes a lot of time and effort. A private label, in particular, accelerates product release into the market. This is what our article will focus on today. Many manufacturers are using data analytics to improve their marketing strategies. Private label supplement manufacturers are among them. Developing Analytics-Driven Marketing Approaches to Private Label Supplement Manufacturing Misunderstandings often arise when people confuse private labels with contract manufacturing. In the former case, the formula for supplements is pre-developed and manufactured, and the client needs to create their own design, brand, and marketing strategy for promotion. In the case of contract manufacturing, the contract manufacturer develops the formula individually for the client, which takes more time and costs more. In the context of private label manufacturing, a specific marketing concept is based on several important elements:  Conducting research and identifying the product’s target audience. Developing a unique proposition and determining the optimal price. Creating a brand promotion strategy and identifying distribution channels. Handling reviews and customer feedback. Monitoring campaign effectiveness and optimising advertising.  As you can understand, analytics technology is playing a huge role in all of these functions. Not long ago, the FDA stated that in the United States, three out of four people take certain dietary supplements daily. Therefore, the product is becoming increasingly popular in the market. However, it is not enough to simply release a product and wait for customers to appear. Market orientation requires specific principles. Firstly, this involves research. Thanks to research, you can understand which types of dietary supplements are in demand among your target audience, what customers are looking for in these supplements, and which segments need to be targeted with supplements to achieve the desired results. Secondly, during research, it is important to consider competitors and be able to analyse their work. This pertains not only to the products they sell but also to the promotion channels, advertising campaigns, and packaging designs they use for attraction. The essence of analysis is to be inspired by your competitors’ work and improve your own product. Maintaining a balance by creating a differentiated private label from competitors is essential because copying not only violates property rights but also reduces users’ trust in the product. An effective marketing strategy here is adaptation to a specific market and audience. You can segment the market into groups of similar consumers and run different advertising campaigns for each. Then, set up private label supplement manufacturing to deliver the desired product to each customer group. All strategies have a common principle: enough time for development and selecting a quality performer.  Development of Individual Supplement Formulations The development of dietary supplements for private labels is based on knowledge of human physiology and biochemical processes that occur in the body under different circumstances. For example, developing sports dietary supplements requires an understanding of an athlete’s energy balance, their lifestyle, the intensity of training, and the amount of exercise. This determines the type of supplement and dosage. For brands, understanding the principle of private label supplement manufacturing is important. This approach helps cover certain aspects that would be the responsibility of the brand in standard manufacturing. When developing products for private labels, clients may encounter the following pitfalls: — Formulation: Only a technologist knows which ingredients can be used, how they combine with each other, and how to create a safe and high-quality product. it is important to seek help from specialists to obtain supplements that solve the tasks set before them. — Stocking: Since dietary supplements have a shelf life, special storage conditions must be provided. Doing this independently is difficult and requires a portion of the budget. A specialised private label supplement manufacturing company has been handling this for years and knows all the intricacies of storing dietary supplements. — Labelling: To ensure that the product complies with the requirements and laws of the country, it is important to correctly label the product and include only what is allowed on the label. Otherwise, dietary supplements may not be released on the market, potentially damaging your brand’s reputation, customers, and finances. If you entrust the task to professionals, the result will be quick and positive. Companies engaged in private label dietary supplement manufacturing invariably invest in R&amp;D (Research and Development), which is aimed at acquiring new knowledge and practical application when creating new products or technologies. Thanks to R&amp;D, manufacturers can offer customers unique formulas and formulations that stand out in the market among competitors. Additionally, R&amp;D ensures that private label manufacturers comply with the quality and safety standards set by regulatory authorities. Packaging and Branding Strategies for Supplements A buyer has just 3 seconds to see a product, assess it, and make a purchasing decision. Therefore, packaging is not merely about protecting dietary supplements from external factors. It is the communication bridge between the brand and the customer. Sufficient time should be devoted to the development and creation of packaging to achieve the desired result. When ordering packaging for private label supplements from a manufacturer, pay attention to the material. It is preferable for the packaging to be made of multi-layered polymer, which will shield dietary supplements from mechanical damage and the influence of sunlight. Regarding packaging design, bright and appealing elements increase the chances of grabbing the customers’ attention. Your design should stand out among competitors while retaining similar characteristics to all dietary supplements. This helps create the right impression of product quality and reliability. Private label manufacturing implies that when you approach the manufacturer, you already have a developed brand logo. This way, you will make your dietary supplements recognizable among competitors. Use a colour scheme and font that resonate with your target audience. For instance, label supplements for men with dark colours, while women prefer warm and light shades. If you are unsure about the packaging design to choose for supplement manufacturing, you can draw inspiration from popular brands. Lately, nearly all brands have embraced minimalism. The trend towards simple and clean styles prevents overwhelming the customer’s life and provides space to develop your own variant. Additionally, brands are increasingly focusing on environmental sustainability. 53% of consumers prefer brands with such a stance, and 75% are even willing to pay more if both the product and packaging are environmentally friendly.  Private Label vs. Branded Supplements: Key Differences When choosing a business approach, some often confuse private label manufacturing and White Label. These are different options, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Let us go through them step by step.  Private label manufacturing is a contract between the customer and the contractor responsible for manufacturing the product. The advantages of such a business include the ability to create a unique brand for dietary supplements. You attract customers and build trust by offering various types of supplements. Moreover, you specify what you want from the contractor, set a competitive price, and brand the product according to your preferences and the audience’s requirements. The drawbacks of private labels include a long manufacturing time and the need for investment. However, it is still cheaper than establishing your own manufacturing line, hiring a team of specialists for recipe development and packaging design. Thanks to private labels, you can focus directly on marketing and promoting dietary supplements, allocating more resources and time to this direction. Branded supplements, or White Label, refer to generic products that can be sold by different distributors. In this case, the manufacturing company even determines the placement of your brand name on the packaging. You will not be able to create unique supplements for your customers and control the manufacturing process. Moreover, the white label manufacturer often offers a batch of products that are in demand in the market, not necessarily among your audience. They do not know the target segment your brand caters to. Growth Trends and Popular Private Label Supplement Products The prosperity of the dietary supplement industry is possible because new products satisfying the audience’s health and fitness needs are introduced to the market daily. If you want to engage in private label supplement manufacturing, it is important to understand what products are popular today.   Protein: The advantage of supplements lies in their various forms – whey protein, casein, vegan protein – allowing you to reach a broader audience. There is always demand for protein, as it promotes muscle mass gain.  BCAA: This supplement aids in muscle tissue recovery, accelerates muscle growth, and speeds up the recovery and healing process. It is suitable for customers who want to recover after intense strength training and is a popular choice for fitness enthusiasts.  Creatine: Athletes use creatine to increase strength, endurance, and muscle mass. Including creatine in your private label supplements allows you to help customers achieve their desired goals and distinguish your brand in the market.  Vitamin Complex: Essential for everyone, as it replenishes the body’s vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Therefore, focusing on this supplement can satisfy a wide audience, from ordinary individuals to world-class athletes.  In the private label supplement industry, the following trends are observed: products with clean labels and innovative compositions. Products with clean labels contain minimal artificial ingredients, supplements, and preservatives, which customers prioritise. Manufacturers of private label supplements are also actively researching ingredients to identify innovative products. This is necessary to enhance the functionality of dietary supplements without resorting to artificial materials. Additionally, private label supplement manufacturers pay special attention to waste reduction and increasingly embrace sustainable environmental development. Big Data Technology is Radically Changing the Supplement Label Manufacturing Sector There are a number of benefits of using big data in manufacturing. One of the subgroups of the manufacturing sector affected is the private label supplement manufacturing field. When establishing a private label for dietary supplements, pay attention to the reliability of the manufacturer and the quality of the products they produce. Your supplements should meet the expectations of your audience, addressing their needs and goals. With this form of collaboration, the manufacturer provides all the necessary services for product manufacturing, allowing you to allocate time and budget to promote dietary supplements in the market. Big data technology has made this easier than ever."},{"score":0.140176460146904,"title":"Jenny Craig to Be Relaunched by Owner of Nutrisystem","id":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jenny-craig-owner-plans-to-bring-it-back-1d422e01","url":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jenny-craig-owner-plans-to-bring-it-back-1d422e01","publishedDate":"2023-07-05","author":"Joseph De Avila","text":"Updated July 5, 2023 9:25 pm ET     Diabetes drugs could become an effective way to treat behavioral issues and addiction.

However, amid the whirlwind of excitement and potential financial gain, it's important not to lose sight of critical factors that can significantly impact the deal. Here, Young Entrepreneur Council members share what they consider the most critical factors to consider before selling your business.\n While it's easy to get lost in the excitement, what's one key factor you must consider when another company offers to buy your business, and why? \n1. Potential bad actors\nCompetitors often express an interest in purchasing a business merely to gain as much information about that business as possible with no intent of actually completing the purchase. Be sure to have a solid mutual non-disclosure agreement in place before you share any of your confidential information, and trust your gut before you share too much of your company's secret sauce. —Doug Bend, Bend Law Group, PC \n2. Your company's price\nThe key factor to consider is what price you're willing to sell your company for. Being clear on your price target will help you quickly determine whether you should proceed with going through the expensive and time-consuming process of completing an M&amp;A transaction. —Nanxi Liu, Blaze.tech \n3. Implications on your lifestyle\nIs your business a “lifestyle” business, built to scale or built to sell? I started with a lifestyle business because I truly love the professional services we offer. After a decade, my focus was on scaling and offering our services to a wider audience. If somebody asked me about buying, I would ask myself what I would do with my time because my work and helping people define a large part of my life. —Givelle Lamano,  Oakland DUI Attorneys  \n4. Your involvement after the sale\nThink about how much you want to stay involved after the deal. It's important because your level of involvement can affect the future direction of the business. You need to decide if you want to continue leading the company, have a transitional role, or step away completely. It's all about finding the right balance between letting go and staying connected. —Abhijeet Kaldate, Astra WordPress Theme \n5. Your company’s value over time\nThe most important factor to consider when another company offers to buy your business is an assessment of where your company will be in the next five or 10 years. This will make it easier for you to decide whether or not you should sell your business. The offer given to you may be lucrative, but you'll know the actual worth of your business after you've carefully estimated its true value. —Stephanie Wells, Formidable Forms \n More articles from   AllBusiness.com  : \n Why You Shouldn’t Be Scared to Build Your Own Website \n 8 In-Demand Senior Care Business Ideas \n6. Maintaining customer relationships\nOne factor that you must consider when another company offers to buy your business is how to continue maintaining customer relationships. You must have invested your time, effort, and money to build a strong customer base, and they might start feeling disconnected if a new company takes over your business. Make sure to talk it out before merging your company with another. —Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster \n7. The deal’s fine print\nDon't forget to read the fine print during the due diligence process. Most deals come with spicy clauses that will impact you personally or your team—like by keeping you aboard for years after the exit or slashing your existing team in half. Openly discuss future goals and commitments on both ends. Don't be surprised if the new direction collides with your vision. —Mario Peshev, Rush \n8. The terms of the deal\nMake sure you're okay with the terms of this deal and that you are ready to meet the requirements of your buyer. Sometimes, agreeing to sell the business is the first step in a long process, which may include growing your business to a certain ROI and meeting very particular milestones before you can sell. You need to be confident in your ability to achieve it within a certain time frame. —Samuel Thimothy,  OneIMS  \n About the Author \n  Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC)   is an invite-only organization comprised of the world’s most successful young entrepreneurs. \n RELATED:   Should You Sell Your Business?

But now it’s much easier, and often more effective, to just take a weekly shot of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, or another so-called miracle drug. As customers embrace the pharma alternative to their traditional businesses, WeightWatchers and Noom are trying to pivot.\n“We’re admitting that we’re learning; that the science has evolved—and therefore we should, as well,” WeightWatchers CEO Sima Sistani told me, about her company’s March deal to buy Sequence, a telehealth business that allows patients to obtain virtual prescriptions for the new weight-loss drugs. Two months later, Noom officially unveiled Noom Med, a similar telehealth platform.\nI spoke with executives at both companies—as well as customers, doctors, analysts, and longtime diet-industry experts—for a new Fortune feature about the impact of the Ozempic era on the traditional weight-loss industry. Even Dr. Linda Anegawa, Noom’s chief medical officer, predicts, “We’re probably looking at the demise of dieting.”\nCould we be so lucky? This is a business story, of course—WeightWatchers and Noom have both struggled financially in recent years, while 40-year-old Jenny Craig just shut down and then sold off its brand to Nutrisystem’s parent company—but it’s also a cultural and societal one.\n   WeightWatchers CEO Sima Sistani at MPW Next Gen on Nov. 16, 2022. Stuart Isett/Fortune \nAnyone who’s ever had the joy of dieting knows how boring, hard, and emotionally fraught it is—and it’s also near-impossible to succeed long-term. The average dieter regains more than 80% of lost weight within five years, according to one meta-analysis of 29 long-term weight-loss studies. But those results haven’t kept the dieting industry from making billions of dollars, for years, by selling products that fundamentally aren’t permanent solutions.\nSo these business pivots raise plenty of outstanding questions about the Ozempic era’s long-term side effects—for investors and executives at WeightWatchers and Noom, for their (shrinking numbers of) employees, for their customers, and for society at large.\n“I do see this as the end of diet culture. The focus has shifted from weight loss to weight health,” acknowledges Sistani, who became WeightWatchers CEO in 2022. However, she’s quick to argue that her 60-year-old company will always be an important part of achieving that new kind of health: “I want to be clear that the way you achieve it is through weight loss.”\nCan she and her traditional diet-industry competitors succeed at threading this needle?
