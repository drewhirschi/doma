The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions. For instance, in August 2022, one of the key dietary supplement brands, You theory launched a line of new liquid dietary supplements post its acquisition by Jamieson Wellness Inc.

Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body‚Äôs optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers‚Äô preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual‚Äôs health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals‚Äô needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population. Similarly, India is emerging as a hub for startups in the personalized nutrition and supplements market. For instance, in April 2020, BhookhaHaathi, an Indian nutraceutical startup, launched AI-based personalized nutrition services. The system collects relevant information to offer customized suggestions. The company is extending its current nutraceutical business.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe constant demand for personalized nutrition &amp; supplement solutions by multiple end-users has created numerous growth opportunities for major players to capitalize on. For instance, in August 2022, Amway announced that it will invest in a microbiome-based startup called Holzapfel Effective Microbes (HEM) to offer tailored probiotic supplement solutions. Amway committed to the second-round investment with HEM, which assists individuals with incurable diseases associated with microbiome dysfunction. The company is actively searching for collaboration opportunities with startups from the U.S., South Korea, Thailand, China, and Indonesia.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Fitness enthusiasts and athletes use supplements to help muscle repair, improve performance, and meet dietary needs. \nConsumers now have easier access to nutritional supplements thanks to the growth of e-commerce platforms. Online shopping lets Customers easily and quickly research, evaluate, and buy various dietary supplements. \nNovel supplement formulations have been made possible by ongoing nutritional science research and development.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic supplements because they trust that these products have undergone rigorous testing and adhere to organic standards. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages. An emphasis on natural and organic ingredients, clean labelling, and individualized nutrition has all impacted consumer preferences for dietary supplements.\nThe belief that specific vitamins could enhance immune system performance, promote healthy bones, or offer antioxidant advantages has sparked consumer curiosity in Vitamin supplements. Countries have different laws governing dietary supplements, and market participants must adhere to strict quality and safety requirements. For instance, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act regulates the U.S. market and lays out precise guidelines for product claims, safety, and labelling. To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market. They frequently have a neutral flavor, are portable, and are simple to consume. Manufacturing dietary supplement tablets with different combinations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, and other bioactive substances is possible. Tablets can be made up of one or more components. They can treat various medical conditions, including immune system support, joint health, and vitamin and mineral shortages. Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling. Dietary supplement sales, particularly those of tablets, are dynamic and subject to change in response to customer preferences and new health issues. As of my latest report, a growing number of people were interested in individualized nutrition, natural and plant-based supplements, and general health and well-being.\nApplication Insights\nThe energy and weight management segment is observed to lead the market in the upcoming years.

The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. ‚ÄúOur consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they‚Äôre more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,‚Äù said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood ‚Äî the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body‚Äôs total serotonin. \n‚ÄúPeople now understand the gut‚Äôs connected to everything,‚Äù said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be ‚Äúprobiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.‚Äù \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company‚Äôs most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer‚Äôs] needs and what‚Äôs top of mind for them,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúFirst is gut health. That‚Äôs the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.‚Äù"},{"score":0.19377872347831726,"title":"Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Report, Size and Forecast Till 2032","id":"https://www.acumenresearchandconsulting.com/plant-based-protein-supplements-market","url":"https://www.acumenresearchandconsulting.com/plant-based-protein-supplements-market","publishedDate":"2024-01-01","author":"","text":"The Global Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Size accounted for USD 5.3 Billion in 2022 and is estimated to achieve a market size of USD 10.8 Billion by 2032 growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2023 to 2032. \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Highlights \nGlobal plant based protein supplements market revenue is poised to garner USD 10.8 billion by 2032 with a CAGR of 7.5% from 2023 to 2032\nNorth America plant-based protein supplements market value occupied around USD 2.2 billion in 2022\nAsia-Pacific plant based protein supplements market growth will record a CAGR of more than 8.6% from 2023 to 2032\nAmong product, the protein powder sub-segment generated over US$ 2.3 billion revenue in 2022\nBased on distribution channel, the online stores sub-segment generated around 60% share in 2022\nFocus on aquatic plants as new &amp; emerging sources of protein is a popular plant based protein supplements market trend that fuels the industry demand\n \nThe plant-based protein supplements market is expanding rapidly as customers increasingly turn to plant-derived sources for their nutritional requirements.

The increasing consumer health awareness and growing demand for retail nutrition products are expected to drive the global industry. Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body‚Äôs optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers‚Äô preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual‚Äôs health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals‚Äô needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population. Similarly, India is emerging as a hub for startups in the personalized nutrition and supplements market. For instance, in April 2020, BhookhaHaathi, an Indian nutraceutical startup, launched AI-based personalized nutrition services. The system collects relevant information to offer customized suggestions. The company is extending its current nutraceutical business.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe constant demand for personalized nutrition &amp; supplement solutions by multiple end-users has created numerous growth opportunities for major players to capitalize on. For instance, in August 2022, Amway announced that it will invest in a microbiome-based startup called Holzapfel Effective Microbes (HEM) to offer tailored probiotic supplement solutions. Amway committed to the second-round investment with HEM, which assists individuals with incurable diseases associated with microbiome dysfunction. The company is actively searching for collaboration opportunities with startups from the U.S., South Korea, Thailand, China, and Indonesia.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions. For instance, in August 2022, one of the key dietary supplement brands, You theory launched a line of new liquid dietary supplements post its acquisition by Jamieson Wellness Inc. The new product comprises of ingredients such as B12B6, K2D3, and ashwagandha offered in liquid and capsule forms.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic supplements because they trust that these products have undergone rigorous testing and adhere to organic standards. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages. An emphasis on natural and organic ingredients, clean labelling, and individualized nutrition has all impacted consumer preferences for dietary supplements.\nThe belief that specific vitamins could enhance immune system performance, promote healthy bones, or offer antioxidant advantages has sparked consumer curiosity in Vitamin supplements. Countries have different laws governing dietary supplements, and market participants must adhere to strict quality and safety requirements. For instance, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act regulates the U.S. market and lays out precise guidelines for product claims, safety, and labelling. To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market. They frequently have a neutral flavor, are portable, and are simple to consume. Manufacturing dietary supplement tablets with different combinations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, and other bioactive substances is possible. Tablets can be made up of one or more components. They can treat various medical conditions, including immune system support, joint health, and vitamin and mineral shortages. Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling. Dietary supplement sales, particularly those of tablets, are dynamic and subject to change in response to customer preferences and new health issues. As of my latest report, a growing number of people were interested in individualized nutrition, natural and plant-based supplements, and general health and well-being.\nApplication Insights\nThe energy and weight management segment is observed to lead the market in the upcoming years.

The increasing consumer health awareness and growing demand for retail nutrition products are expected to drive the global industry. Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body‚Äôs optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers‚Äô preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual‚Äôs health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals‚Äô needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population. Similarly, India is emerging as a hub for startups in the personalized nutrition and supplements market. For instance, in April 2020, BhookhaHaathi, an Indian nutraceutical startup, launched AI-based personalized nutrition services. The system collects relevant information to offer customized suggestions. The company is extending its current nutraceutical business.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe constant demand for personalized nutrition &amp; supplement solutions by multiple end-users has created numerous growth opportunities for major players to capitalize on. For instance, in August 2022, Amway announced that it will invest in a microbiome-based startup called Holzapfel Effective Microbes (HEM) to offer tailored probiotic supplement solutions. Amway committed to the second-round investment with HEM, which assists individuals with incurable diseases associated with microbiome dysfunction. The company is actively searching for collaboration opportunities with startups from the U.S., South Korea, Thailand, China, and Indonesia.

Over the next 7-10 years, it is expected to grow by 9% year-on-year. This is a huge amount, especially considering that many industries are seeing market retractions due to a looming recession.  But why is the dietary supplements industry rapidly growing while other industries are faltering? Are there any key trends that we should be on the lookout for over the next few years?  Let‚Äôs take a dive into the industry and answer these questions. The Growth of the Dietary Supplements Industry In the next seven years, the massive dietary supplement industry is expected to double. Very few industries will come close to this, especially in the face of recession. The reasons behind this substantial growth are multifaceted. Rising Health and Product Awareness More and more people are becoming aware of the importance of maintaining their health. They understand why getting a good blend of vitamins and nutrients is essential. Some people may even understand a little about the impact of certain nutrients on the body. As a result, they will head out and find products they know can help them. This phenomenon is observed frequently in the fitness industry. Head to any gym, and you‚Äôll find people touting the benefits of proteins for muscle building, caffeine for staying alert, creatine, carbs, and more. This heightened awareness is unprecedented. Why it has happened is anybody‚Äôs guess, but it is likely influenced by greater access to the internet. People talk about fitness on websites, social media, and more. This is fantastic. The more people are aware of how important it is to look after your health, the better! Of course, the fact that products are marketed more is also helping. It isn‚Äôt enough for people to know they need to be healthy; they need to know the products that can help make them healthier. Look around, and you‚Äôll see supplements mentioned in tons of places now ‚Äì on TV, in magazines, on social media, on YouTube, and more. Growth of Sports Nutrition The area that has seen the most growth in the supplements industry has been sports nutrition. The most significant surge in sales of sports supplements occurred during 2021/2022. Many speculate that the growth was driven by the average person‚Äôs desire to get healthy after spending time inside due to COVID-19 shutdowns worldwide. Sports nutrition was likely also driven heavily by the growth of product options on the market. Gone are the days when things were about protein powders and steroids (don‚Äôt touch steroids), but you can now find unique product formulations designed to target specific workouts. For example ‚Äì pre-workouts are rising in popularity for those who crave the extra dose of nutrients to keep them focused and driven on exercise. Increased Access to Products Perhaps the major driving force behind the growth of the dietary supplements industry is access to products. A few years ago, sourcing supplements would have been hard. While you likely would have found standard supplements at certain health stores (or even your local grocery store), e.g., vitamins, some minerals, and proteins, you wouldn‚Äôt have found anywhere near the range that is available today.  So, if you were a bodybuilder (for instance), you would either need to make do without the nutritional supplements that everybody else was using or spend an age trying to track down where they came from, no doubt going through countless shady sources (i.e., products that didn‚Äôt work) before you found a supplements company that worked. Nowadays, everything is out in the open. Companies like Huge Supplements sell a huge selection of products online. These products can be bought almost anywhere in the world, and you have a greater selection than ever. Obviously, when product access increases, the market will increase, too. Increased Age of Population As the population ages, the demand for health supplements increases. This is because many people will take their health much more seriously or help keep certain health conditions at bay. This is likely going to be a major factor in the supplements industry going forward, particularly with vitamins and minerals and products specially formulated to combat age-related conditions e.g., reducing wrinkles, combatting diabetes, etc. Shift in Diets There are some people who are looking into supplements to help fill a void in changing diets. It is fair to say that in this fast-paced world, people aren‚Äôt quite putting together the delectable dishes that people would have done in the decades past. This means some people are sorely lacking in certain nutrients, and supplements are helping with this. Trends in the Dietary Supplements Industry As the dietary supplements industry gains traction, discernible trends are beginning to emerge. Part of this is through the desire of new companies to stand out from the crowd, while other trends are through the desire of customers to have their supplements provided differently. The anticipation is that the following trends could persist over the years. Better Product Formulation Nutritional science is better than ever, and a lot of cash is spent on product development. Compare the supplement formulations from today to those of just a few years ago; it is night and day. There is a notable improvement in comprehending the impact of certain ingredients on the body, and companies are looking into ways to apply the scientifically proven beneficial nutrients into their supplements. The places where supplements are produced are better equipped, too. Take Huge Supplements, for instance. They are a big business that has invested much time and effort into product formulation. Only the highest quality ingredients are used, and their products can deliver results that others cannot. More Direct Sales While standard retail sales still constitute the majority of sales for specific products such as vitamins and certain powders, a shift is evident towards more direct sales. This means that people are buying directly from the manufacturer of the product. This means a few things: \nCheaper prices\nBetter quality products\nA more direct relationship with those producing the product.\nA larger range of products.\n Again, companies like Huge Supplements are driving the industry here. Never before have so many supplements been available from a single company.  More Personalized Supplements This is a new part of the supplement industry, but it is expected to be a major focus for a few companies in the coming years. More personalized supplements will allow people to tailor their supplement stacks to their needs.  It is already possible to some extent when you shop at businesses that sell a large array of supplements, but in the future, there will likely be more choices in what goes into the supplements. This means that no supplement will be the same. It will always be tailored to the user. The Future of the Dietary Supplements Industry The dietary supplements industry is only going to continue to grow. As it does, expect more product innovation, options, and greater investment in the business. Nowadays, the supplements on the market are better and healthier for us than ever before. In the future? That could improve even further thanks to improved science, product formulation, and access to products. This growing industry holds promise for exciting developments.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages. An emphasis on natural and organic ingredients, clean labelling, and individualized nutrition has all impacted consumer preferences for dietary supplements.\nThe belief that specific vitamins could enhance immune system performance, promote healthy bones, or offer antioxidant advantages has sparked consumer curiosity in Vitamin supplements. Countries have different laws governing dietary supplements, and market participants must adhere to strict quality and safety requirements. For instance, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act regulates the U.S. market and lays out precise guidelines for product claims, safety, and labelling. To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market. They frequently have a neutral flavor, are portable, and are simple to consume. Manufacturing dietary supplement tablets with different combinations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, and other bioactive substances is possible. Tablets can be made up of one or more components. They can treat various medical conditions, including immune system support, joint health, and vitamin and mineral shortages. Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling.

The increasing consumer health awareness and growing demand for retail nutrition products are expected to drive the global industry. Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body‚Äôs optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers‚Äô preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual‚Äôs health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals‚Äô needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population.

These supplements are made from soy, pea, hemp, spirulina, pumpkin seeds, and rice, and they provide a more sustainable and ethical alternative to animal-based protein products. The market is being driven by increased global demand for vegan and vegetarian products, with e-commerce playing an important role in making them more accessible. Retail behemoths like Wal-Mart are pushing their suppliers to provide more plant-based options, indicating the market's potential for development. Furthermore, health-conscious consumers are switching to vegan diets to minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to meat intake.

The rapid expansion of e-commerce has contributed to the consumption of protein supplements. Walmart, as the largest retailer, is encouraging its suppliers to offer more plant-based items. Additionally, the rising concern for food safety in the food and beverage sector is driving the demand for high-quality food service and liquid packaging boards.\nThe growing importance of a vegan diet, driven by concerns about cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes associated with the consumption of meat products, is expected to positively impact market growth. The global market is projected to witness substantial growth over the next eight years, driven by the increasing population of flexitarians in the United States and Canada, thanks to extensive campaigns promoting vegetarian diets through various media platforms.\nFurthermore, the rising awareness of glutamic disorders and lactose intolerance among millennials in developed markets like Germany and the United States is expected to boost the consumption of soy and pea protein supplements. Many manufacturers distribute their products through various channels, including e-commerce portals, direct sales contracts, and supermarkets. These products are available in various forms, such as powder, liquids, ready-to-drink (RTD) options, and capsules.      \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Segmentation \nThe worldwide market for plant based protein supplements is split based on product, application, distribution channel, raw material, and geography.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Products \nProtein Powder\nProtein Bars\nReady-to-Drink (RTD)\nOthers\nThe protein powder category leads the plant-based protein supplements sector due to its diversity and ease. Protein powders are simple to add into a variety of dishes and beverages, giving consumers greater flexibility in their use. Furthermore, they are frequently regarded as a pure and concentrated source of plant-based protein, making them a favoured choice for people attempting to reach their daily protein intake targets. Protein powder's versatility and nutritional worth have catapulted it to market leadership.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Applications \nSports Nutrition\nAdditional Nutrition\nSports nutrition dominates the market for plant-based protein supplements due to rising demand from athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Plant-based protein supplements are in line with the emerging trend of clean and sustainable nutrition, and they appeal to people looking for protein sources that help with muscle recovery, performance, and overall health. These supplements provide an effective solution for physically active people to achieve their protein needs while still adhering to their dietary preferences and environmental considerations. Increased participation in sports and fitness activities by health-conscious consumers has propelled the sports nutrition segment to market leadership in the plant-based protein supplements market.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Distribution Channels \nSupermarket\nOnline Stores\nDTC\nOthers\nFor numerous reasons, the online store segment leads the plant-based protein supplements industry. For starters, it provides consumers with convenience by allowing them to browse and purchase a wide range of things from the comfort of their own homes. Second, online platforms give plant-based protein supplement makers access to a global market, broadening their reach. Furthermore, internet retailers frequently offer competitive pricing, promotions, and customer feedback, which improves the whole purchasing experience. As more people turn to e-commerce for their nutritional needs, the online retailers category continues to prosper as the preferred distribution channel for plant-based protein supplements.\n Plant Based Protein Supplement Raw Materials \nSoy\nSpirulina\nPumpkin Seed\nHemp\nRice\nPea\nOthers\nWihin the raw material segment the soy sub-segment held the largest share of the market. The soy segment's dominance in the plant-based protein supplements market can be ascribed to many important factors.\nComplete protein profile is an important aspect in boosting growth. Soy protein is regarded as a high-quality, complete protein source, containing adequate amounts of all essential amino acids. This makes it a popular choice among consumers searching for a complete protein supplement with an amino acid profile similar to that of animal-based proteins.\nAnother motivator is nutritional value. Iron, calcium, and B vitamins are among the necessary minerals found in soy protein. Because of its nutritional fullness and versatility, it is an appealing option for individuals looking for a well-rounded dietary supplement.\n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Regional Outlook \n North America \nU.S.\nCanada\n Europe \nU.K.\nGermany\nFrance\nSpain\nRest of Europe\n Asia-Pacific \nIndia\nJapan\nChina\nAustralia\nSouth Korea\nRest of Asia-Pacific\n Latin America \nBrazil\nMexico\nRest of Latin America\n The Middle East &amp; Africa \nSouth Africa\nGCC Countries\nRest of the Middle East &amp; Africa (ME&amp;A)\n \n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Regional Analysis \nNorth America accounted for 41% of the global revenue share in 2022. The increasing awareness of vegan diets and the growing trend toward vegetarianism, driven by new brand campaigns on social media and television, is expected to drive the demand for plant-based protein supplements in the near future. The demand in the U.S. is expected to grow steadily over the forecast period due to the increasing consumption of sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, rising concerns about weight management and growing consumer awareness of the importance of a nutritious diet and a healthy lifestyle are expected to support regional market growth over the forecast period.\nEurope has a thriving industry for plant-based products, including supplements. This market's progress is fueled by factors comparable to those in North America, such as rising health consciousness, environmental concerns, and the growing popularity of vegan and vegetarian diets.\nAsia-Pacific is projected to remain one of the most profitable markets for plant-based protein supplements in the next eight years. The growth of the middle-class population in developing countries, including China and India, along with increased state government spending on infrastructure development and a favorable taxation environment for multinational companies (MNCs) to establish offices, is expected to drive demand.\n Plant Based Protein Supplements Market Players \nSome of the top plant based protein supplements companies offered in our report includes Glanbia plc, AMCO Proteins, Quest Nutrition, NOW Foods, The Bountiful Company, MusclePharm Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, IOVATE Health Sciences International, Inc., Transparent Labs, and WOODBOLT DISTRIBUTION LLC."},{"score":0.18887828290462494,"title":"Personalized Nutrition And Supplements Market Report, 2030","id":"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/personalized-nutrition-supplements-market-report","url":"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/personalized-nutrition-supplements-market-report","publishedDate":"2023-10-01","author":"","text":"Report Overview \nThe global personalized nutrition and supplements market size was valued at USD 43.40 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.0% from 2023 to 2030. The increasing consumer health awareness and growing demand for retail nutrition products are expected to drive the global industry. Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body‚Äôs optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers‚Äô preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual‚Äôs health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals‚Äô needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population. Similarly, India is emerging as a hub for startups in the personalized nutrition and supplements market. For instance, in April 2020, BhookhaHaathi, an Indian nutraceutical startup, launched AI-based personalized nutrition services. The system collects relevant information to offer customized suggestions. The company is extending its current nutraceutical business.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe constant demand for personalized nutrition &amp; supplement solutions by multiple end-users has created numerous growth opportunities for major players to capitalize on. For instance, in August 2022, Amway announced that it will invest in a microbiome-based startup called Holzapfel Effective Microbes (HEM) to offer tailored probiotic supplement solutions. Amway committed to the second-round investment with HEM, which assists individuals with incurable diseases associated with microbiome dysfunction.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic supplements because they trust that these products have undergone rigorous testing and adhere to organic standards. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements.

The global market for food fortifying agents has been growing as consumers become more conscious of their health and nutrition. Fortified foods offer a convenient way to ensure that individuals receive essential nutrients, especially when certain nutrients are not naturally present in sufficient quantities in the diet.

Factors such as poor dietary choices, limited food variety, and soil depletion of minerals can contribute to deficiencies. Fortifying foods with minerals help ensure that people receive an adequate intake to support overall health.  Public Health Initiatives: Governments and health organizations often implement public health initiatives to address specific nutritional challenges within populations. Fortifying staple foods with minerals is a targeted and cost-effective way to reach a large segment of the population and prevent widespread deficiencies.  Prevention of Health Conditions: Certain minerals are critical for the prevention of various health conditions. For example, fortifying foods with iron can help combat iron deficiency anemia, especially in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and young children. Similarly, calcium fortification is important for bone health and can contribute to the prevention of conditions like osteoporosis.  Targeted Nutrition: Food fortification allows for targeted nutrition, addressing the specific needs of different demographic groups. For instance, fortifying foods with iodine is crucial for preventing iodine deficiency disorders, particularly in regions where natural sources of iodine are limited.  Convenience and Accessibility: Fortifying commonly consumed foods with minerals ensures that individuals can easily incorporate these nutrients into their diet without significant changes in eating habits. This approach is particularly valuable in addressing nutrient gaps in populations where access to a diverse range of foods is limited.  Compliance with Dietary Guidelines: Fortification aligns with dietary guidelines that recommend adequate intake of essential minerals. It helps bridge the gap between recommended nutrient levels and actual consumption, promoting a more balanced and healthful diet.

This surge is not only a testament to the region's economic growth but also mirrors a growing interest among middle-class consumers in nutrition and supplements. Omega-3 nutritional supplements, renowned for their health benefits, are particularly in demand, symbolizing a shift towards proactive health management. Proteins and amino acids stand out as dynamic segments across the Asia Pacific, with key markets including China, India, Japan, and Australia &amp; New Zealand. These countries, rich in agriculture, play a pivotal role in the production of high-fiber content plants and oilseeds, serving as primary raw materials for fiber and specialty carbohydrate ingredients.  Transformative Shift in Food Industry  The processed food industry in the Asia Pacific region undergoes a metamorphosis, responding to changing customer lifestyles shaped by rapid urbanization, diet diversification, and liberalization of foreign direct investment. Rising incomes and increased purchasing power fuel a dramatic transformation in the food &amp; beverage sector, with consumers expressing a heightened demand for nutritional and healthy products.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages. An emphasis on natural and organic ingredients, clean labelling, and individualized nutrition has all impacted consumer preferences for dietary supplements.\nThe belief that specific vitamins could enhance immune system performance, promote healthy bones, or offer antioxidant advantages has sparked consumer curiosity in Vitamin supplements. Countries have different laws governing dietary supplements, and market participants must adhere to strict quality and safety requirements. For instance, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act regulates the U.S. market and lays out precise guidelines for product claims, safety, and labelling. To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market. They frequently have a neutral flavor, are portable, and are simple to consume. Manufacturing dietary supplement tablets with different combinations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, and other bioactive substances is possible. Tablets can be made up of one or more components. They can treat various medical conditions, including immune system support, joint health, and vitamin and mineral shortages. Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling. Dietary supplement sales, particularly those of tablets, are dynamic and subject to change in response to customer preferences and new health issues.

The increasing consumer health awareness and growing demand for retail nutrition products are expected to drive the global industry. Furthermore, increasing accurate data collection is anticipated to assist companies in personalizing supplements in any form. For instance, in December 2020, Revieve announced the launch of a digital advisor solution known as the AI Nutrition Advisor. The advisor is expected to allow users to discover their body‚Äôs optimal requirement for vitamins and supplements.\n \nThe increasing incidence of lifestyle diseases, growing concerns about inadequate nutrition, and a large geriatric population are some of the key factors responsible for the rising demand for retained nutrition products. With an increase in the incidence of various illnesses, people are adopting a healthy lifestyle to obtain optimum nutrition for preventing them. According to Diana Food, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted consumers‚Äô preference toward personalized nutrition. Around 70% of the U.K. population would like to understand the impact of lifestyle on long-term health, 40% of the people in Germany reported preferring using personalized supplements, and 72% of Chinese are open to sharing health data to receive personalized services.\nMoreover, the introduction of wearable solutions that offer a broader and more relevant depiction of an individual‚Äôs health and physical activity is an example of product innovation in this sector. This covers heart rate and calorie intake along with detailing their sleeping patterns and stress levels. Wearable devices are trending as they play an instrumental role in making users conscious of their health and assist in monitoring their vitals &amp; wellness. Companies in the wearables market for personalized nutrition are engaged in product development, such as hearables, smart glasses, and clothing.\nFurthermore, in May 2022, ProPhase Labs announced a 211% increase in sales of genomics tests for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, to USD 47.5 million from USD 15.3 million at the end of the March 2021 quarter. The company stated that the growing demand for tests in personalized nutrition, coupled with the rising need for COVID-19 tests, contributed to the growth in revenue. Companies are incorporating various indicators in their testing portfolio to gain a competitive edge. Key indicators are food intolerance, genetic markers, eating behavior, weight management, cardiometabolic health, and genetic information.\nHowever, supplements are highly regulated and monitored by officials across the globe. The purpose of the regulation is to increase consumer protection and ensure the fulfillment of labeling requirements by companies. In the U.S., the FDA regulates dietary ingredients and finished supplement products under conventional foods &amp; drug products. Under the regulations, manufacturers &amp; distributors are prohibited from marketing products that are misbranded or adulterated. While, in India, nutraceuticals are regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety &amp; Standard Act 2006.\n Ingredient Insights \nThe vitamins segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 31.85% of the overall revenue. Vitamin supplements provide an easy way to fill any nutrient gaps that people might have in their diets. According to the study published in June 2022 in JAMA Network Open, 31% of surveyed respondents use multi-mineral supplements. In January 2022, Dr. Heather Moday recommended three essential vitamins for the human body in her article on CNBC. Furthermore, product development in the segment is expected to boost market growth. For instance, in February 2022, Nourished announced the launch of a vegan-based vitamin D3 ingredient.\nThrough 3D printing, users can incorporate a dose of vitamin D3, which is six times more powerful than the previous version. The study showed that vitamin D3 supplements can increase the count of T cells. Probiotics ingredient is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. Foods, such as yogurt, are the key natural sources of probiotics. Probiotics are emerging as a popular dietary supplement. According to the National Institutes of Health, the sales of probiotics supplements are projected to be more than USD 64 billion in 2023.\n Dosage Form Insights \nThe tablets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 65.00% of the overall revenue. Tablets are the most common form of supplement and thus accounted for the largest revenue share in 2022. They are safe to consume, inexpensive to produce, and effective at delivering nutrients. Tablets can be produced in various shapes and sizes. These are developed by adding powdered ingredients to create a solid tablet that can easily break down inside the digestive tract. Furthermore, most tablets have additives that enhance their texture, appearance, or taste. While others have a coating to avoid breakdown before going through the small intestine, where the major nutrients are adsorbed.\nSimilarly, capsules are another form of supplement. Although in capsules, the nutrition is encapsulated in an outer shell, which breaks down in the digestive tract, then it is absorbed into the bloodstream to be metabolized and distributed. The advantage of liquid-form supplements and vitamins is that they are easier to customize by adding various dosages of different nutrients to develop a personalized mix. The liquid form segment is expected to witness the fastest growth rate during the forecast period due to the increasing usage by children and older adults. Supplements in this form are easy for the aging population to consume, and also get absorbed faster into the system.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe supermarkets segment dominated the industry in 2022 and accounted for the largest share of more than 43.55% of the overall revenue. The key driver of this segment is the frequency of users visiting supermarkets since it is considered to be a one-stop destination for groceries supplies. A large number of players are initiating collaboration with supermarkets to increase their sales. For instance, Renovatio is an Australia-based company that offers immune-boosting supplements through its website and numerous pharmacy stores. In October 2020, the company collaborated with Woolworths, a supermarket giant, to offer its products via the supermarket.\nThe first shipment would include approximately 32,000 units with a retail valuation of USD 0.71 million (AUD 1.1 million) and is anticipated to deliver products worth USD 3.25 million (AUD 5 million) by the end of the year. A specialty store is defined as a marketplace with a specific category of goods available for sale. Specialty stores hold a significant share of Personalized Nutrition &amp; Supplements. Furthermore, to enhance the sales of products, stores arrange educational sessions for consumers. For instance, Natural Grocers offers free education on personalized nutrition along with a wide range of supplements and vitamins collection across its 162 stores.\n Age Group Insights \nA large proportion of users of personalized nutrition &amp; supplements are adults. An unhealthy lifestyle at the age of 21 to 55 years increases the risk of diet-related issues. The acceleration of stress levels, coupled with alcohol intake and lack of nutritional foods, increases nutrition deficiency. According to the survey conducted by Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) for the year 2022, 75% of U.S. citizens are consumers of dietary supplements. The usage is higher among older adults, women, and higher-income &amp; and more educated individuals.\n \nFurthermore, increasing awareness of the impact of personalized nutrition on infants is anticipated to boost its adoption by pediatric clinics. For instance, in January 2021, a study published by the National Library of Medicine stated that personalized diets tailored to individuals‚Äô needs are more effective for preventing chronic diseases. Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) algorithms are emerging as an important technology in pediatric settings, which help professionals offer personalized nutrition.\n Regional Insights \nNorth America accounted for the largest share of 41.51% in 2022 owing to the presence of major companies, extensive government funding, and an increase in research activities in the region. The presence of well-developed infrastructure for developing AI-based platforms for personalized nutrition is one of the major factors responsible for market growth. For instance, in October 2022, GenoPalate, Inc. announced an investment of USD 5.6 million through equity financing to support its product line in personalized nutrition. The company provides personalized supplements and online programs on nutrition. GenoPalate is enhancing its nutritional health data platform on the web- and mobile-based applications.\n \nAsia Pacific, on the other hand, is expected to grow at the fastest growth rate during the forecast period owing to robust product pipelines in personalized nutrition &amp; supplements and a large patient population. Similarly, India is emerging as a hub for startups in the personalized nutrition and supplements market. For instance, in April 2020, BhookhaHaathi, an Indian nutraceutical startup, launched AI-based personalized nutrition services. The system collects relevant information to offer customized suggestions. The company is extending its current nutraceutical business.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe constant demand for personalized nutrition &amp; supplement solutions by multiple end-users has created numerous growth opportunities for major players to capitalize on. For instance, in August 2022, Amway announced that it will invest in a microbiome-based startup called Holzapfel Effective Microbes (HEM) to offer tailored probiotic supplement solutions.

Over the next 7-10 years, it is expected to grow by 9% year-on-year. This is a huge amount, especially considering that many industries are seeing market retractions due to a looming recession.  But why is the dietary supplements industry rapidly growing while other industries are faltering? Are there any key trends that we should be on the lookout for over the next few years?  Let‚Äôs take a dive into the industry and answer these questions. The Growth of the Dietary Supplements Industry In the next seven years, the massive dietary supplement industry is expected to double. Very few industries will come close to this, especially in the face of recession. The reasons behind this substantial growth are multifaceted. Rising Health and Product Awareness More and more people are becoming aware of the importance of maintaining their health. They understand why getting a good blend of vitamins and nutrients is essential. Some people may even understand a little about the impact of certain nutrients on the body. As a result, they will head out and find products they know can help them. This phenomenon is observed frequently in the fitness industry. Head to any gym, and you‚Äôll find people touting the benefits of proteins for muscle building, caffeine for staying alert, creatine, carbs, and more. This heightened awareness is unprecedented. Why it has happened is anybody‚Äôs guess, but it is likely influenced by greater access to the internet. People talk about fitness on websites, social media, and more. This is fantastic. The more people are aware of how important it is to look after your health, the better! Of course, the fact that products are marketed more is also helping. It isn‚Äôt enough for people to know they need to be healthy; they need to know the products that can help make them healthier. Look around, and you‚Äôll see supplements mentioned in tons of places now ‚Äì on TV, in magazines, on social media, on YouTube, and more. Growth of Sports Nutrition The area that has seen the most growth in the supplements industry has been sports nutrition. The most significant surge in sales of sports supplements occurred during 2021/2022. Many speculate that the growth was driven by the average person‚Äôs desire to get healthy after spending time inside due to COVID-19 shutdowns worldwide. Sports nutrition was likely also driven heavily by the growth of product options on the market. Gone are the days when things were about protein powders and steroids (don‚Äôt touch steroids), but you can now find unique product formulations designed to target specific workouts. For example ‚Äì pre-workouts are rising in popularity for those who crave the extra dose of nutrients to keep them focused and driven on exercise. Increased Access to Products Perhaps the major driving force behind the growth of the dietary supplements industry is access to products. A few years ago, sourcing supplements would have been hard. While you likely would have found standard supplements at certain health stores (or even your local grocery store), e.g., vitamins, some minerals, and proteins, you wouldn‚Äôt have found anywhere near the range that is available today.  So, if you were a bodybuilder (for instance), you would either need to make do without the nutritional supplements that everybody else was using or spend an age trying to track down where they came from, no doubt going through countless shady sources (i.e., products that didn‚Äôt work) before you found a supplements company that worked. Nowadays, everything is out in the open. Companies like Huge Supplements sell a huge selection of products online. These products can be bought almost anywhere in the world, and you have a greater selection than ever. Obviously, when product access increases, the market will increase, too. Increased Age of Population As the population ages, the demand for health supplements increases. This is because many people will take their health much more seriously or help keep certain health conditions at bay. This is likely going to be a major factor in the supplements industry going forward, particularly with vitamins and minerals and products specially formulated to combat age-related conditions e.g., reducing wrinkles, combatting diabetes, etc. Shift in Diets There are some people who are looking into supplements to help fill a void in changing diets. It is fair to say that in this fast-paced world, people aren‚Äôt quite putting together the delectable dishes that people would have done in the decades past. This means some people are sorely lacking in certain nutrients, and supplements are helping with this. Trends in the Dietary Supplements Industry As the dietary supplements industry gains traction, discernible trends are beginning to emerge. Part of this is through the desire of new companies to stand out from the crowd, while other trends are through the desire of customers to have their supplements provided differently. The anticipation is that the following trends could persist over the years. Better Product Formulation Nutritional science is better than ever, and a lot of cash is spent on product development. Compare the supplement formulations from today to those of just a few years ago; it is night and day. There is a notable improvement in comprehending the impact of certain ingredients on the body, and companies are looking into ways to apply the scientifically proven beneficial nutrients into their supplements. The places where supplements are produced are better equipped, too. Take Huge Supplements, for instance. They are a big business that has invested much time and effort into product formulation. Only the highest quality ingredients are used, and their products can deliver results that others cannot. More Direct Sales While standard retail sales still constitute the majority of sales for specific products such as vitamins and certain powders, a shift is evident towards more direct sales. This means that people are buying directly from the manufacturer of the product. This means a few things: \nCheaper prices\nBetter quality products\nA more direct relationship with those producing the product.\nA larger range of products.\n Again, companies like Huge Supplements are driving the industry here. Never before have so many supplements been available from a single company.  More Personalized Supplements This is a new part of the supplement industry, but it is expected to be a major focus for a few companies in the coming years. More personalized supplements will allow people to tailor their supplement stacks to their needs.  It is already possible to some extent when you shop at businesses that sell a large array of supplements, but in the future, there will likely be more choices in what goes into the supplements. This means that no supplement will be the same. It will always be tailored to the user. The Future of the Dietary Supplements Industry The dietary supplements industry is only going to continue to grow. As it does, expect more product innovation, options, and greater investment in the business. Nowadays, the supplements on the market are better and healthier for us than ever before. In the future? That could improve even further thanks to improved science, product formulation, and access to products. This growing industry holds promise for exciting developments.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions. For instance, in August 2022, one of the key dietary supplement brands, You theory launched a line of new liquid dietary supplements post its acquisition by Jamieson Wellness Inc. The new product comprises of ingredients such as B12B6, K2D3, and ashwagandha offered in liquid and capsule forms. This new launch is in line with the growing consumer demand for the nutritional supplements in the U.S. Some of the prominent players in the U.S. dietary supplements market include:\nAmway\nAbbott\nBayer AG\nGlanbia plc.\nPfizer Inc.\nArcher Daniels Midland\nGlaxoSmithKline plc.\nNU SKIN\nHerbalife Nutrition\nNature's Sunshine Products Inc.\nDuPont de Nemours Inc.\nNOW Foods\n Report Attribute \n Details \nRevenue forecast in 2030\nUSD 78.94 billion\nGrowth rate (Revenue)\nCAGR of 5.7% from 2023 to 2030\nBase year for estimation\n2022\nHistorical data\n2017 - 2021\nForecast period\n2023 - 2030\nQuantitative units\nRevenue in USD million/billion, CAGR from 2023 to 2030\nReport coverage\nRevenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, trends\nSegments covered\nIngredient, form, application, end-user, type, distribution channel\nRegional scope\nU.S.\nKey companies profiled\nAmway; Abbott; Bayer AG; Glanbia plc.; Pfizer Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland; GlaxoSmithKline plc.; NU SKIN; Herbalife Nutrition; Nature's Sunshine Products Inc.; DuPont de Nemours Inc.; NOW Foods\nCustomization scope\nFree report customization (equivalent up to 8 analyst‚Äôs working days) with purchase.

Today, there are more than 95,000.  According to the FDA, which oversees the supplement industry as part of the food category, there are currently around 4,000 brands selling into the supplement space, which includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, drink mixes, vitamin gummies, protein powers and anything else that ‚Äúsupplements‚Äù one‚Äôs diet with nutritional ingredients.  \nThe supplement category was worth around $57 billion last year, according to Future Market Insights, and it‚Äôs projected to reach $239 billion by 2028, according to Research and Markets.\nVitamin therapy was first used in Western medicine in the early 1900s to treat issues like rickets or scurvy, which were caused by deficiencies in calcium and vitamin C, respectively. Commercialized vitamins were inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine and hit the market in the 1930s. But it wasn‚Äôt until the 1970s that vitamins gained mass popularity, according to the National Library of Medicine. \nHowever, experts believe that it was the global Covid-19 pandemic that caused the largest sea change. ‚ÄòHealth is wealth‚Äô became a core value across demographics and, today, more than 75% of Americans take at least one supplement per day, according to Mintel. What‚Äôs more, a third of supplement users have increased their supplement intake since the pandemic and half of millennials are using supplements more often than they did before the pandemic. \n The beauty industry has joined in with an expansion of the ‚ÄúInside outside‚Äù product trend, which includes targeting issues like hair health with a corresponding topical and ingestible combination, often sold bundled.  Last year, Unilever acquired a majority stake in Nutrafol, a hair-health-focused supplement brand available in Sephora. And earlier this month, L‚ÄôOr√©al backed a Swiss biotech company called Timeline with a proprietary molecule said to increase cell longevity through ingestibles. Celebrities have also lined up to enter the space. Kate Hudson‚Äôs InBloom range of vitamin-packed drink mixes is available at Whole Foods; Jennifer Lopez sells a beauty multivitamin as part of her JLo Beauty line; Steve Harvey‚Äôs L‚ÄôEvate You offers green drink mixes to boost energy; and, as of this week, designer Stella McCartney announced her foray into the space with a new multivitamin targeted toward skin health.  \nOf course, the Kardashian-Jenners, who led the way in the space promoting biotin hair gummies on social media nearly a decade ago, have now earned a growing market share. To wit: Kourney Kardashian‚Äôs Lemme gummies, tinctures and pills just landed in Target stores. \nQ1 is the most important selling season of the year for the wellness industry, and as more brands enter the space, those leading in innovation and safety are doubling down on their points of difference. They say providing this information has become increasingly important as customers become more educated about America‚Äôs loose regulations and the growing public concern over purity and transparency. \nTo learn about the issues facing top supplement brands today, as well as where the industry could be headed in the next year, Glossy talked with industry leaders to discuss the strategies that have proven the most effective in this expanding category. Leading with data, focusing on education and preparing for inevitable new regulation were the top topics discussed, as described below. \n Data should help lead product development \nPaying attention to new ingredient curiosity among consumers is crucial, so brands like Hum Nutrition have let their customers lead part of their product development strategy. \n‚ÄúWe select the concerns [our community] would like us to formulate for,‚Äù Walter Faulstroh, CEO and co-founder of Hum Nutrition, told Glossy. The company gathers this information through an on-site quiz and monitors analytics on its blog and social media. \n ‚ÄúIt has helped us sharpen our R&amp;D process and be ahead of the game a little bit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor example, we saw very early on that berberine was trending [online] as an ingredient, so glucose level management is definitely a hot topic. Berberine had a big moment [online], and we were one of the first brands to speak about that ingredient on our blog and we saw a real appetite from our audience. We couldn‚Äôt find a clean version of berberine in the market, so we decided to launch it, and it‚Äôs one of our best sellers now.‚Äù  Hum Nutrition launched in 2012 and is privately held. It employs more than 100 people and has taken on four rounds of funding, according to PitchBook. Hum is sold DTC and in Sephora, Target and Nordstrom, among other retailers. \n Having captivating educational content is a non-negotiable \nBrand marketing has usurped growth marketing across industries thanks to growing customer acquisition costs, leading many brands to lean deeper into creating educational, SEO-optimized digital content. Seven-year-old Ritual, an industry leader that surpassed $100 million in sales in 2021, is leaning deeper into educating potential customers about its unique offerings. \nLindsay Dahl, chief impact officer at Ritual, told Glossy that the brand uses a variety of analytics to see what content is being consumed on its blog, which covers primers on vitamin types and sustainability explainers, among other topics. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly looking at what kind of content is resonating with people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor example, we did this guide on how to shop the supplements aisle. It‚Äôs so funny because that type of content for other industries is kind of played out, but in our industry, it‚Äôs not.‚Äù Ritual has also seen success in discussing misconceptions around synthetic versus natural ingredients, sourcing and a supplement‚Äôs carbon footprint, to name examples. ‚ÄúThat myth-busting type of content really educates consumers,‚Äù she said. \nA recent social media success for Hum was a campaign around its Flatter Me digestive enzyme. The content included Bill Nye-like experiments titled ‚ÄúFlatter Me versus food,‚Äù where viewers can see how Flatter Me breaks down food in a bowl in just a few hours. ‚ÄúWe were thinking, ‚ÄòOK, how can we demonstrate that this product works? How can we showcase it breaking down the food?‚Äù Faulstroh said. \nA ‚ÄúFlatter me versus Thanksgiving‚Äù video collected more than 300,000 views, when most of the brand‚Äôs TikToks get under 1,000 views. ‚ÄúFlatter me versus pumpkin pie‚Äù received over a million views this fall. Today, Flatter Me is the brand‚Äôs top seller. \n‚ÄúFollower count doesn‚Äôt matter. Having a Gen Z person running [your TikTok] does,‚Äù Faulstroh said. \nFor Perelel, a brand launched in 2020 with a focus on nutritional support for all stages of a woman‚Äôs reproductive journey, building trust started with a rigorous amount of content. The aim was to teach consumers about its scientific process, doctor-stacked panel and other points of difference. ‚Äú[Our customer began to] trust us because of the doctors that are involved in the formulation and all the content that comes with it,‚Äù said Alex Taylor, co-founder and co-CEO of Perelel Health. \nPerelel secured $4.7 million in seed funding from Unilever Ventures and others last year. \n Sustainability is becoming table-stakes \n‚ÄúWe get a lot of important and interesting questions around packaging,‚Äù said Ritual‚Äôs Dahl. ‚ÄùAt first, people don‚Äôt understand why our multivitamin bottles are made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic [instead of glass]. Understanding why that is a lower carbon option [requires] telling those stories around the complexities that go into our packaging selection.‚Äù\n In 2021, Hum implemented a program to swap all of its virgin plastic packaging for ocean-bound plastic and found it a win-win. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a big cost difference, it was just a question of working with the right supply chain partners,‚Äù Hum‚Äôs Faulstroh told Glossy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about pennies [per bottle].‚Äù Hum began swapping virgin plastic for recycled plastic in 2021 and keeps a tally of its efforts on its website. As of this week, its running counter of ocean-bound plastic bottles that it‚Äôs diverted from becoming pollution exceeds 24 million. \nUse of plastic is a growing concern among consumers that Hum is looking to get ahead of. For example, in a report published in December 2022 in the Journal of Cleaner Production, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, ‚ÄúThe use of recycled plastic is stated to have positively affected purchase decisions of 86% of consumers [studied].‚Äù \n Purity is a fast-growing consumer value \nThanks in part to a growing number of investigations and lawsuits, conscious consumers are becoming increasingly educated about the issues plaguing the supplement industry, such as contamination and inaccurate labeling. \n‚ÄúTransparency is king, especially in an industry where there‚Äôs a high level of skepticism,‚Äù Ritual‚Äôs Dahl told Glossy. \nFor example, in 2015, the New York State Attorney General‚Äôs office tested supplements from Walmart, Walgreens, Target and GNC and found that four out of five contained none of the herbs listed on the bottle. Instead, many included a mix of rice, garlic and house plants.\nMore recently, lawsuits around inaccurate labeling of ingredient levels have sparked consumer outrage. Last year, a line of kid‚Äôs melatonin supplements called Zarbee‚Äôs was sued after an independent lab allegedly found more than 200x the amount of melatonin supposed to be in a bottle. Procter &amp; Gamble is in a similar suit for its Vicks Pure Zzzs Nightly Sleep, which is alleged to have included 150x the amount of melatonin on the package. \nAs customers become more savvy shoppers, transparency and purity will become even more important, which experts say requires third-party, randomized testing for true consumer trust.\n‚ÄúOf course we can say we hold ourselves accountable, but [brands] need that outside verification to keep everyone in check,‚Äù HUM‚Äôs Faulstroh told Glossy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really proud to have all products certified by the Clean Label Project.‚Äù \nBrands including Ritual, MaryRuth‚Äôs, Puori, Goli and dozens others have also gained certification from Clean Label Project. The non-profit company purchases products already in the market, as a consumer would, before testing them with a third-party accredited lab. This ensures a randomness that better ensures broad safety and applies a checks-and-balances-like system into the supply chain, said Jackie Bowen, executive director of Clean Label Project. \nContrary to what one may assume, testing is not prohibitively expensive: Bowen told Glossy that labs charge about $120 to test a bottle of vitamins for lead, for example. It entails heating the product to the temperature of the sun until everything disintegrates except any heavy metal contaminants. \nHeavy metals, which include lead, arsenic and mercury, among others, are naturally found in the earth‚Äôs crust. But, because of mining, fracking and other industrial processes, they often contaminate the soil and water, and find their way into plants harvested for vitamins. This causes contaminated products, as well. \nSo why isn‚Äôt the testing process more common? ‚ÄúOnce you have certain information, you‚Äôre obligated to do something about it,‚Äù Bowen said. She believes that brands would rather not know about contamination than be forced to revamp an entire supply chain after gaining undesired test results. \nClean Label Project also does broad category testing. ‚ÄúWhen we test a category, we use IRI or Nielsen data to figure out which products make up 80% of the overall retail sales in America [and we focus on testing those],‚Äù Bowen said. ‚ÄúWhat we typically see is the ‚ÄòPareto principle,‚Äô where 80% of the contaminant load comes from 20% of the industry.‚Äù \nBowen said that a value-focused MSRP correlates less than one may assume with contamination. Instead, certain vitamin types, like fish oil, mined minerals, herbs and hemp, are more inherently contaminated, no matter the cost of the bottle to a consumer.\n Preparedness for inevitable regulatory changes is crucial \nCurrently, the supplement market is regulated by the FDA, primarily through the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. It treats supplements like food, so manufacturers don‚Äôt have to prove efficacy or safety before going to market. Meanwhile, the FTC regulates claims made by brands and retailers. \n‚ÄúWe are at a potential tipping point for a new frontier of safety and regulation in dietary supplements,‚Äù Bowen said. ‚ÄúThe entire dietary supplement industry should sit up and take notice of what is happening within prenatal vitamins.‚Äù\nThat is, there‚Äôs a cultural shift toward brands that can prove efficacy and purity for an increasingly discerning generation of women. Quickly growing brands, like Ritual, Perelel and Hum, carry out third-party testing to ensure safety, which some of the industry is either unwilling or unable to copy. For example, in a report released earlier this month by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the group that provides auditing, evaluative and investigative services for Congress, researchers found that half of the prenatal supplements tested were positive for heavy metals lead or cadmium. It also found that ‚Äú11 of 12 prenatal supplements had at least one nutrient above or below the levels noted on label.‚Äù \nBowen believes that the framework for substantial regulation on supplements was created with the recent controversy around baby formula and food. After numerous investigations by the media and a congressional investigation in 2021, Americans became aware of ubiquitous lead contamination in popular baby food brands like Gerber, Beech-Nut, Earth‚Äôs Best Organic and many others. \nAs happens with many industries, California legislation has outpaced the FDA. In 2023, California pushed the goalpost further with AB988, a new law requiring all baby food manufacturers that sell into California to test representative samples for toxic ingredients like heavy metals on a monthly basis\nThis, as one might expect, led to hyper-awareness of the safety of prenatal vitamins. In 2023, the FDA released new recommended limits for heavy metals as part of a campaign to raise awareness of contamination testing, called ‚ÄúCloser to Zero.‚Äù \nThe Federal Trade Commission has also stepped in with a new compliance guidance in December of 2022. ‚ÄúThe FTC is going to ramp up, and we want that,‚Äù said Victoria Thain Gioia, founder and co-CEO of Perelel Health. ‚Äú[We hope] they will cut back on the outrageous claims that companies can say and force [marketers] to be more buttoned up on telling the truth of what‚Äôs in your product.‚Äù\nBowen believes change will start on the West Coast. ‚ÄúThe state of California is going to ultimately set federal policy by just being that much more nimble and being able to implement what it is that consumers have wanted for years,‚Äù Bowen said. She said this will be the framework for how the next wave of regulation reaches the American marketplace and dramatically shifts the market share in the favor of early adopters.\nAs part of its 2024 legislative proposal, the FDA has requested enhanced authority to regulate foods made for infants and young children, including testing requirements for contaminants, as well as supplements for all ages. \nRitual, which is based on total transparency in sourcing and purity, a first for the industry, also launched a campaign in 2023 to lobby Congress for more regulation. \n ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for bipartisan movements on supplement reform. Now that there‚Äôs been an explosion of the industry and the FDA is now asking for more oversight, you have companies like Ritual asking for more oversight,‚Äù Dahl told Glossy. ‚ÄúThis is the perfect recipe for the beginning of change.‚Äù"},{"score":0.14656253159046173,"title":"Dietary Supplements Market Size to Hit US$ 346.36 Bn by 2032","id":"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dietary-supplements-market","url":"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dietary-supplements-market","publishedDate":"2024-01-01","author":"","text":"Report Description \n Table of Content \n Request Customization \n The global dietary supplements market size was estimated at USD 176.19 billion in 2023 and is expected to hit USD 346.36 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 7.8% during the estimated period 2023 to 2032.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles. People with hectic schedules and convenience-driven meal choices may need more nutrients, making them look for dietary supplements to stay healthy.\nSports nutrition supplements are in greater demand as people's interest in fitness and sports activities grows. Fitness enthusiasts and athletes use supplements to help muscle repair, improve performance, and meet dietary needs. \nConsumers now have easier access to nutritional supplements thanks to the growth of e-commerce platforms. Online shopping lets Customers easily and quickly research, evaluate, and buy various dietary supplements. \nNovel supplement formulations have been made possible by ongoing nutritional science research and development.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic supplements because they trust that these products have undergone rigorous testing and adhere to organic standards. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages. An emphasis on natural and organic ingredients, clean labelling, and individualized nutrition has all impacted consumer preferences for dietary supplements.\nThe belief that specific vitamins could enhance immune system performance, promote healthy bones, or offer antioxidant advantages has sparked consumer curiosity in Vitamin supplements. Countries have different laws governing dietary supplements, and market participants must adhere to strict quality and safety requirements. For instance, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act regulates the U.S. market and lays out precise guidelines for product claims, safety, and labelling. To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market. They frequently have a neutral flavor, are portable, and are simple to consume. Manufacturing dietary supplement tablets with different combinations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, and other bioactive substances is possible. Tablets can be made up of one or more components. They can treat various medical conditions, including immune system support, joint health, and vitamin and mineral shortages. Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling. Dietary supplement sales, particularly those of tablets, are dynamic and subject to change in response to customer preferences and new health issues. As of my latest report, a growing number of people were interested in individualized nutrition, natural and plant-based supplements, and general health and well-being.\nApplication Insights\nThe energy and weight management segment is observed to lead the market in the upcoming years. Rising global obesity rates have heightened awareness about weight management. Individuals seeking to lose or control weight often turn to dietary supplements as part of their wellness journey. Growing awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle has driven the popularity of weight management supplements. Consumers are proactively seeking products that support overall well-being, including weight control.\nRecent Developments\nIn November 2023, Your Good Night Acute Sticks, a clinically backed private-label dietary supplement for enhancing many sleep quality measures and immediately impacting acute sleep latency difficulties, was launched by Pharma Linea. \nIn December 2023, a pioneer in the production and distribution of cutting-edge, natural dietary supplements, BioAdaptives Inc., announced the creation of PROTEINnMORETM, a cutting-edge, plant-based supplement intended to enhance strength and muscle-building. As preserving and increasing lean muscle mass is a critical objective in fitness and weight management, BioAdaptives plans to release Fit Your Outfit (FYO), the AI-based body composition measuring app, in the first quarter of 2024.\n Dietary Supplements Market Players \nBayer\nNBTY Inc\nBionova Lifesciences\nNu Skin Enterprises\nCarlyle Group\nPfizer\nArkopharma Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques\nGlanbia\nHerbalife International\nAbbott Laboratories\nGlaxoSmithKline\nNature‚Äôs Sunshine Forms\nAmway\nArcher Daniels Midland\n Major Market Segments Covered: \n By Ingredient \nVitamins\nMinerals\nFibers &amp; Specialty Carbohydrates\nOmega Fatty Acids\nBotanicals\nProteins &amp; Amino Acids\nOthers\n By Form \nCapsules\nTablets\nGummies\nSoft gels\nLiquids\nPowders\nOthers\n By Application \nEnergy &amp; Weight Management\nBone &amp; Joint Health\nDiabetes\nGeneral Health\nImmunity\nCardiac Health\nGastrointestinal Health\nAnti-cancer\nLungs Detox/Cleanse\nSexual Health\nBrain/Mental Health\nSkin/Hair/Nails\nInsomnia\nAnti-aging\nMenopause\nPrenatal Health\nOthers\n By End User \nAdults\nGeriatric\nPregnant Women\nChildren\nInfants\n By Type \nOTC\nPrescribed\n By Distribution Channel  \nOffline\nHypermarkets/Supermarkets\nPharmacies\nSpecialty Stores\nPractioner\nOthers\nOnline\n By Function \nAdditional supplements\nMedicinal supplements\nSports nutrition\n By Geography \nNorth America\nU.S.\nCanada\nEurope\nGermany\nFrance\nUnited Kingdom\nRest of Europe\nAsia Pacific\nChina\nJapan\nIndia\nSoutheast Asia\nRest of Asia Pacific\nLatin America\nBrazil\nRest of Latin America\nMiddle East &amp; Africa (MEA)\nGCC\nNorth Africa\nSouth Africa\nRest of Middle East &amp; Africa\nFrequently Asked Questions\n The dietary supplements market size was reached at USD 176.19 billion in 2023 and is projected to hit USD 346.36 billion by 2032. \n Rising health awareness among the individuals across the globe along with, growing focus on the dietary habits due to changing lifestyle are among major factors boosting growth of the global industry.

The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. ‚ÄúOur consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they‚Äôre more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,‚Äù said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood ‚Äî the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body‚Äôs total serotonin. \n‚ÄúPeople now understand the gut‚Äôs connected to everything,‚Äù said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be ‚Äúprobiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.‚Äù \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company‚Äôs most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer‚Äôs] needs and what‚Äôs top of mind for them,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúFirst is gut health. That‚Äôs the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.‚Äù"},{"score":0.16079619526863098,"title":"Mars to buy healthy food maker Kevin's Natural Foods","id":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/mars-buy-healthy-food-maker-kevins-natural-foods-2023-07-05/","url":"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/mars-buy-healthy-food-maker-kevins-natural-foods-2023-07-05/","publishedDate":"2023-07-05","author":"Anirban Sen; Abigail Summerville","text":"NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Family-owned food giant Mars Inc on Wednesday agreed to buy Kevin's Natural Foods, which is known for its sous-vide meals, sauces, and side dishes, the companies said. The deal values private equity-backed Kevin's at nearly $800 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Kevin's started exploring options, which included a sale of the company, earlier this year. McLean, Virginia-based Mars, which generates about $48 billion in annual sales, has three major businesses - Mars Petcare, Mars Snacking, and Mars Food &amp; Nutrition. After the deal is completed, Kevin's will operate as a standalone brand under the food and nutrition unit. In petcare, Mars operates brands like Pedigree, Whiskas, and Royal Canin, and it recently expanded its footprint in the sector through the acquisition of veterinary equipment firm Heska Corp. Mars, widely known as the maker of candy brands like M&amp;M's and Snickers, has made a series of acquisitions in recent years as part of its efforts to diversify and build out its categories focused on healthy foods and snacking. Mars plans to grow its food business through more potential acquisitions in the near term, said Shaid Shah, global president at Mars Food &amp; Nutrition. \"We are trying to deliver on a mission we have to enable healthier and more flavorful diets for consumers worldwide, while Kevin's is trying to empower the busiest people to eat clean without sacrificing flavors,\" Shah said in an interview. \"What really inspired us about Kevin's was their purpose and their passion for food,\" he added. Modesto, California-based Kevin's, which counted private equity firms TowerBrook Capital Partners and NewRoad Capital Partners among its backers, was co-founded in 2019 by Dan Costa, Kelsie Costa-Olson, and Kevin McCray. TowerBrook and NewRoad are selling their stake in Kevin's as part of the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023. McCray launched Kevin's after he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, as he wanted to build a food brand that focused on healthy diets. \"Joining the Mars Food &amp; Nutrition portfolio of brands will allow us to accelerate the development of more product innovations and support our mission of bringing Kevin‚Äôs to more consumers across markets,\" McCray said. The food and beverage sector has been a relatively bright spot for dealmaking in recent quarters, even as overall consumer deal volumes remain muted. Unilever (ULVR.L) last month said it would buy frozen yogurt brand Yasso in North America, while Flagstone Foods acquired Emerald Nuts from Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) in May. Citi served as financial adviser and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, Covington &amp; Burling and ArentFox Schiff acted as legal advisers to Mars.

From another perspective, however, M&amp;As appear to be picking up, and those same declining deal values in the first half of 2023 represent the third highest amount since 2017. Upcoming pricing negotiations as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the U.S. FTC‚Äôs recent challenge to the Amgen Inc. and Horizon Therapeutics plc merger agreement, as well as returning investors in the financial markets, have impacted dealmaking and merger efforts in the second quarter.

In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.‚Äù"},{"score":0.18358114361763,"title":"Dietary Supplements Market Size to Hit US$ 346.36 Bn by 2032","id":"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dietary-supplements-market","url":"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dietary-supplements-market","publishedDate":"2024-01-01","author":"","text":"Report Description \n Table of Content \n Request Customization \n The global dietary supplements market size was estimated at USD 176.19 billion in 2023 and is expected to hit USD 346.36 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 7.8% during the estimated period 2023 to 2032.

Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products.

The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions.

Over the next 7-10 years, it is expected to grow by 9% year-on-year. This is a huge amount, especially considering that many industries are seeing market retractions due to a looming recession.  But why is the dietary supplements industry rapidly growing while other industries are faltering? Are there any key trends that we should be on the lookout for over the next few years?  Let‚Äôs take a dive into the industry and answer these questions. The Growth of the Dietary Supplements Industry In the next seven years, the massive dietary supplement industry is expected to double. Very few industries will come close to this, especially in the face of recession. The reasons behind this substantial growth are multifaceted. Rising Health and Product Awareness More and more people are becoming aware of the importance of maintaining their health. They understand why getting a good blend of vitamins and nutrients is essential. Some people may even understand a little about the impact of certain nutrients on the body. As a result, they will head out and find products they know can help them. This phenomenon is observed frequently in the fitness industry. Head to any gym, and you‚Äôll find people touting the benefits of proteins for muscle building, caffeine for staying alert, creatine, carbs, and more. This heightened awareness is unprecedented. Why it has happened is anybody‚Äôs guess, but it is likely influenced by greater access to the internet. People talk about fitness on websites, social media, and more. This is fantastic. The more people are aware of how important it is to look after your health, the better! Of course, the fact that products are marketed more is also helping. It isn‚Äôt enough for people to know they need to be healthy; they need to know the products that can help make them healthier. Look around, and you‚Äôll see supplements mentioned in tons of places now ‚Äì on TV, in magazines, on social media, on YouTube, and more. Growth of Sports Nutrition The area that has seen the most growth in the supplements industry has been sports nutrition. The most significant surge in sales of sports supplements occurred during 2021/2022. Many speculate that the growth was driven by the average person‚Äôs desire to get healthy after spending time inside due to COVID-19 shutdowns worldwide. Sports nutrition was likely also driven heavily by the growth of product options on the market. Gone are the days when things were about protein powders and steroids (don‚Äôt touch steroids), but you can now find unique product formulations designed to target specific workouts. For example ‚Äì pre-workouts are rising in popularity for those who crave the extra dose of nutrients to keep them focused and driven on exercise. Increased Access to Products Perhaps the major driving force behind the growth of the dietary supplements industry is access to products. A few years ago, sourcing supplements would have been hard. While you likely would have found standard supplements at certain health stores (or even your local grocery store), e.g., vitamins, some minerals, and proteins, you wouldn‚Äôt have found anywhere near the range that is available today.  So, if you were a bodybuilder (for instance), you would either need to make do without the nutritional supplements that everybody else was using or spend an age trying to track down where they came from, no doubt going through countless shady sources (i.e., products that didn‚Äôt work) before you found a supplements company that worked. Nowadays, everything is out in the open. Companies like Huge Supplements sell a huge selection of products online. These products can be bought almost anywhere in the world, and you have a greater selection than ever. Obviously, when product access increases, the market will increase, too. Increased Age of Population As the population ages, the demand for health supplements increases. This is because many people will take their health much more seriously or help keep certain health conditions at bay. This is likely going to be a major factor in the supplements industry going forward, particularly with vitamins and minerals and products specially formulated to combat age-related conditions e.g., reducing wrinkles, combatting diabetes, etc. Shift in Diets There are some people who are looking into supplements to help fill a void in changing diets. It is fair to say that in this fast-paced world, people aren‚Äôt quite putting together the delectable dishes that people would have done in the decades past. This means some people are sorely lacking in certain nutrients, and supplements are helping with this. Trends in the Dietary Supplements Industry As the dietary supplements industry gains traction, discernible trends are beginning to emerge. Part of this is through the desire of new companies to stand out from the crowd, while other trends are through the desire of customers to have their supplements provided differently. The anticipation is that the following trends could persist over the years. Better Product Formulation Nutritional science is better than ever, and a lot of cash is spent on product development. Compare the supplement formulations from today to those of just a few years ago; it is night and day. There is a notable improvement in comprehending the impact of certain ingredients on the body, and companies are looking into ways to apply the scientifically proven beneficial nutrients into their supplements. The places where supplements are produced are better equipped, too. Take Huge Supplements, for instance. They are a big business that has invested much time and effort into product formulation. Only the highest quality ingredients are used, and their products can deliver results that others cannot. More Direct Sales While standard retail sales still constitute the majority of sales for specific products such as vitamins and certain powders, a shift is evident towards more direct sales. This means that people are buying directly from the manufacturer of the product. This means a few things: \nCheaper prices\nBetter quality products\nA more direct relationship with those producing the product.\nA larger range of products.\n Again, companies like Huge Supplements are driving the industry here. Never before have so many supplements been available from a single company.  More Personalized Supplements This is a new part of the supplement industry, but it is expected to be a major focus for a few companies in the coming years. More personalized supplements will allow people to tailor their supplement stacks to their needs.  It is already possible to some extent when you shop at businesses that sell a large array of supplements, but in the future, there will likely be more choices in what goes into the supplements. This means that no supplement will be the same. It will always be tailored to the user. The Future of the Dietary Supplements Industry The dietary supplements industry is only going to continue to grow. As it does, expect more product innovation, options, and greater investment in the business. Nowadays, the supplements on the market are better and healthier for us than ever before. In the future? That could improve even further thanks to improved science, product formulation, and access to products. This growing industry holds promise for exciting developments.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products.

The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements.

To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market.

Today, there are more than 95,000.  According to the FDA, which oversees the supplement industry as part of the food category, there are currently around 4,000 brands selling into the supplement space, which includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, drink mixes, vitamin gummies, protein powers and anything else that ‚Äúsupplements‚Äù one‚Äôs diet with nutritional ingredients.  \nThe supplement category was worth around $57 billion last year, according to Future Market Insights, and it‚Äôs projected to reach $239 billion by 2028, according to Research and Markets.\nVitamin therapy was first used in Western medicine in the early 1900s to treat issues like rickets or scurvy, which were caused by deficiencies in calcium and vitamin C, respectively. Commercialized vitamins were inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine and hit the market in the 1930s. But it wasn‚Äôt until the 1970s that vitamins gained mass popularity, according to the National Library of Medicine. \nHowever, experts believe that it was the global Covid-19 pandemic that caused the largest sea change. ‚ÄòHealth is wealth‚Äô became a core value across demographics and, today, more than 75% of Americans take at least one supplement per day, according to Mintel. What‚Äôs more, a third of supplement users have increased their supplement intake since the pandemic and half of millennials are using supplements more often than they did before the pandemic. \n The beauty industry has joined in with an expansion of the ‚ÄúInside outside‚Äù product trend, which includes targeting issues like hair health with a corresponding topical and ingestible combination, often sold bundled.  Last year, Unilever acquired a majority stake in Nutrafol, a hair-health-focused supplement brand available in Sephora. And earlier this month, L‚ÄôOr√©al backed a Swiss biotech company called Timeline with a proprietary molecule said to increase cell longevity through ingestibles. Celebrities have also lined up to enter the space. Kate Hudson‚Äôs InBloom range of vitamin-packed drink mixes is available at Whole Foods; Jennifer Lopez sells a beauty multivitamin as part of her JLo Beauty line; Steve Harvey‚Äôs L‚ÄôEvate You offers green drink mixes to boost energy; and, as of this week, designer Stella McCartney announced her foray into the space with a new multivitamin targeted toward skin health.  \nOf course, the Kardashian-Jenners, who led the way in the space promoting biotin hair gummies on social media nearly a decade ago, have now earned a growing market share. To wit: Kourney Kardashian‚Äôs Lemme gummies, tinctures and pills just landed in Target stores. \nQ1 is the most important selling season of the year for the wellness industry, and as more brands enter the space, those leading in innovation and safety are doubling down on their points of difference. They say providing this information has become increasingly important as customers become more educated about America‚Äôs loose regulations and the growing public concern over purity and transparency. \nTo learn about the issues facing top supplement brands today, as well as where the industry could be headed in the next year, Glossy talked with industry leaders to discuss the strategies that have proven the most effective in this expanding category. Leading with data, focusing on education and preparing for inevitable new regulation were the top topics discussed, as described below. \n Data should help lead product development \nPaying attention to new ingredient curiosity among consumers is crucial, so brands like Hum Nutrition have let their customers lead part of their product development strategy. \n‚ÄúWe select the concerns [our community] would like us to formulate for,‚Äù Walter Faulstroh, CEO and co-founder of Hum Nutrition, told Glossy. The company gathers this information through an on-site quiz and monitors analytics on its blog and social media. \n ‚ÄúIt has helped us sharpen our R&amp;D process and be ahead of the game a little bit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor example, we saw very early on that berberine was trending [online] as an ingredient, so glucose level management is definitely a hot topic. Berberine had a big moment [online], and we were one of the first brands to speak about that ingredient on our blog and we saw a real appetite from our audience. We couldn‚Äôt find a clean version of berberine in the market, so we decided to launch it, and it‚Äôs one of our best sellers now.‚Äù  Hum Nutrition launched in 2012 and is privately held. It employs more than 100 people and has taken on four rounds of funding, according to PitchBook. Hum is sold DTC and in Sephora, Target and Nordstrom, among other retailers. \n Having captivating educational content is a non-negotiable \nBrand marketing has usurped growth marketing across industries thanks to growing customer acquisition costs, leading many brands to lean deeper into creating educational, SEO-optimized digital content. Seven-year-old Ritual, an industry leader that surpassed $100 million in sales in 2021, is leaning deeper into educating potential customers about its unique offerings. \nLindsay Dahl, chief impact officer at Ritual, told Glossy that the brand uses a variety of analytics to see what content is being consumed on its blog, which covers primers on vitamin types and sustainability explainers, among other topics. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly looking at what kind of content is resonating with people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor example, we did this guide on how to shop the supplements aisle. It‚Äôs so funny because that type of content for other industries is kind of played out, but in our industry, it‚Äôs not.‚Äù Ritual has also seen success in discussing misconceptions around synthetic versus natural ingredients, sourcing and a supplement‚Äôs carbon footprint, to name examples. ‚ÄúThat myth-busting type of content really educates consumers,‚Äù she said. \nA recent social media success for Hum was a campaign around its Flatter Me digestive enzyme. The content included Bill Nye-like experiments titled ‚ÄúFlatter Me versus food,‚Äù where viewers can see how Flatter Me breaks down food in a bowl in just a few hours. ‚ÄúWe were thinking, ‚ÄòOK, how can we demonstrate that this product works? How can we showcase it breaking down the food?‚Äù Faulstroh said. \nA ‚ÄúFlatter me versus Thanksgiving‚Äù video collected more than 300,000 views, when most of the brand‚Äôs TikToks get under 1,000 views. ‚ÄúFlatter me versus pumpkin pie‚Äù received over a million views this fall. Today, Flatter Me is the brand‚Äôs top seller. \n‚ÄúFollower count doesn‚Äôt matter. Having a Gen Z person running [your TikTok] does,‚Äù Faulstroh said. \nFor Perelel, a brand launched in 2020 with a focus on nutritional support for all stages of a woman‚Äôs reproductive journey, building trust started with a rigorous amount of content. The aim was to teach consumers about its scientific process, doctor-stacked panel and other points of difference. ‚Äú[Our customer began to] trust us because of the doctors that are involved in the formulation and all the content that comes with it,‚Äù said Alex Taylor, co-founder and co-CEO of Perelel Health. \nPerelel secured $4.7 million in seed funding from Unilever Ventures and others last year. \n Sustainability is becoming table-stakes \n‚ÄúWe get a lot of important and interesting questions around packaging,‚Äù said Ritual‚Äôs Dahl. ‚ÄùAt first, people don‚Äôt understand why our multivitamin bottles are made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic [instead of glass]. Understanding why that is a lower carbon option [requires] telling those stories around the complexities that go into our packaging selection.‚Äù\n In 2021, Hum implemented a program to swap all of its virgin plastic packaging for ocean-bound plastic and found it a win-win. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a big cost difference, it was just a question of working with the right supply chain partners,‚Äù Hum‚Äôs Faulstroh told Glossy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about pennies [per bottle].‚Äù Hum began swapping virgin plastic for recycled plastic in 2021 and keeps a tally of its efforts on its website. As of this week, its running counter of ocean-bound plastic bottles that it‚Äôs diverted from becoming pollution exceeds 24 million. \nUse of plastic is a growing concern among consumers that Hum is looking to get ahead of. For example, in a report published in December 2022 in the Journal of Cleaner Production, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, ‚ÄúThe use of recycled plastic is stated to have positively affected purchase decisions of 86% of consumers [studied].‚Äù \n Purity is a fast-growing consumer value \nThanks in part to a growing number of investigations and lawsuits, conscious consumers are becoming increasingly educated about the issues plaguing the supplement industry, such as contamination and inaccurate labeling. \n‚ÄúTransparency is king, especially in an industry where there‚Äôs a high level of skepticism,‚Äù Ritual‚Äôs Dahl told Glossy. \nFor example, in 2015, the New York State Attorney General‚Äôs office tested supplements from Walmart, Walgreens, Target and GNC and found that four out of five contained none of the herbs listed on the bottle. Instead, many included a mix of rice, garlic and house plants.\nMore recently, lawsuits around inaccurate labeling of ingredient levels have sparked consumer outrage. Last year, a line of kid‚Äôs melatonin supplements called Zarbee‚Äôs was sued after an independent lab allegedly found more than 200x the amount of melatonin supposed to be in a bottle. Procter &amp; Gamble is in a similar suit for its Vicks Pure Zzzs Nightly Sleep, which is alleged to have included 150x the amount of melatonin on the package. \nAs customers become more savvy shoppers, transparency and purity will become even more important, which experts say requires third-party, randomized testing for true consumer trust.\n‚ÄúOf course we can say we hold ourselves accountable, but [brands] need that outside verification to keep everyone in check,‚Äù HUM‚Äôs Faulstroh told Glossy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really proud to have all products certified by the Clean Label Project.‚Äù \nBrands including Ritual, MaryRuth‚Äôs, Puori, Goli and dozens others have also gained certification from Clean Label Project. The non-profit company purchases products already in the market, as a consumer would, before testing them with a third-party accredited lab. This ensures a randomness that better ensures broad safety and applies a checks-and-balances-like system into the supply chain, said Jackie Bowen, executive director of Clean Label Project. \nContrary to what one may assume, testing is not prohibitively expensive: Bowen told Glossy that labs charge about $120 to test a bottle of vitamins for lead, for example. It entails heating the product to the temperature of the sun until everything disintegrates except any heavy metal contaminants. \nHeavy metals, which include lead, arsenic and mercury, among others, are naturally found in the earth‚Äôs crust. But, because of mining, fracking and other industrial processes, they often contaminate the soil and water, and find their way into plants harvested for vitamins. This causes contaminated products, as well. \nSo why isn‚Äôt the testing process more common? ‚ÄúOnce you have certain information, you‚Äôre obligated to do something about it,‚Äù Bowen said. She believes that brands would rather not know about contamination than be forced to revamp an entire supply chain after gaining undesired test results. \nClean Label Project also does broad category testing. ‚ÄúWhen we test a category, we use IRI or Nielsen data to figure out which products make up 80% of the overall retail sales in America [and we focus on testing those],‚Äù Bowen said. ‚ÄúWhat we typically see is the ‚ÄòPareto principle,‚Äô where 80% of the contaminant load comes from 20% of the industry.‚Äù \nBowen said that a value-focused MSRP correlates less than one may assume with contamination. Instead, certain vitamin types, like fish oil, mined minerals, herbs and hemp, are more inherently contaminated, no matter the cost of the bottle to a consumer.\n Preparedness for inevitable regulatory changes is crucial \nCurrently, the supplement market is regulated by the FDA, primarily through the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. It treats supplements like food, so manufacturers don‚Äôt have to prove efficacy or safety before going to market. Meanwhile, the FTC regulates claims made by brands and retailers. \n‚ÄúWe are at a potential tipping point for a new frontier of safety and regulation in dietary supplements,‚Äù Bowen said. ‚ÄúThe entire dietary supplement industry should sit up and take notice of what is happening within prenatal vitamins.‚Äù\nThat is, there‚Äôs a cultural shift toward brands that can prove efficacy and purity for an increasingly discerning generation of women. Quickly growing brands, like Ritual, Perelel and Hum, carry out third-party testing to ensure safety, which some of the industry is either unwilling or unable to copy. For example, in a report released earlier this month by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the group that provides auditing, evaluative and investigative services for Congress, researchers found that half of the prenatal supplements tested were positive for heavy metals lead or cadmium. It also found that ‚Äú11 of 12 prenatal supplements had at least one nutrient above or below the levels noted on label.‚Äù \nBowen believes that the framework for substantial regulation on supplements was created with the recent controversy around baby formula and food. After numerous investigations by the media and a congressional investigation in 2021, Americans became aware of ubiquitous lead contamination in popular baby food brands like Gerber, Beech-Nut, Earth‚Äôs Best Organic and many others. \nAs happens with many industries, California legislation has outpaced the FDA. In 2023, California pushed the goalpost further with AB988, a new law requiring all baby food manufacturers that sell into California to test representative samples for toxic ingredients like heavy metals on a monthly basis\nThis, as one might expect, led to hyper-awareness of the safety of prenatal vitamins. In 2023, the FDA released new recommended limits for heavy metals as part of a campaign to raise awareness of contamination testing, called ‚ÄúCloser to Zero.‚Äù \nThe Federal Trade Commission has also stepped in with a new compliance guidance in December of 2022. ‚ÄúThe FTC is going to ramp up, and we want that,‚Äù said Victoria Thain Gioia, founder and co-CEO of Perelel Health. ‚Äú[We hope] they will cut back on the outrageous claims that companies can say and force [marketers] to be more buttoned up on telling the truth of what‚Äôs in your product.‚Äù\nBowen believes change will start on the West Coast. ‚ÄúThe state of California is going to ultimately set federal policy by just being that much more nimble and being able to implement what it is that consumers have wanted for years,‚Äù Bowen said. She said this will be the framework for how the next wave of regulation reaches the American marketplace and dramatically shifts the market share in the favor of early adopters.\nAs part of its 2024 legislative proposal, the FDA has requested enhanced authority to regulate foods made for infants and young children, including testing requirements for contaminants, as well as supplements for all ages. \nRitual, which is based on total transparency in sourcing and purity, a first for the industry, also launched a campaign in 2023 to lobby Congress for more regulation. \n ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for bipartisan movements on supplement reform. Now that there‚Äôs been an explosion of the industry and the FDA is now asking for more oversight, you have companies like Ritual asking for more oversight,‚Äù Dahl told Glossy. ‚ÄúThis is the perfect recipe for the beginning of change.‚Äù"},{"score":0.18661461770534515,"title":"M&A in US Food and Beverage CPG: Three Key Themes‚ÄîEvolving Consumer Needs and Category Expansion and Focus","id":"https://coresight.com/research/m-a-in-us-food-and-beverage-cpg-three-key-themes-evolving-consumer-needs-and-category-expansion-and-focus/","url":"https://coresight.com/research/m-a-in-us-food-and-beverage-cpg-three-key-themes-evolving-consumer-needs-and-category-expansion-and-focus/","publishedDate":"2023-07-24","author":"Nitheesh NH","text":"What's Inside The food and beverage consumer packaged goods (CPG) category in the US has witnessed over 100 mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals over the past four years, as CPG food and beverage companies have increasingly found these deals favorable.\nExamining recent M&amp;A deals, we explore three key themes in M&amp;A in the US food and beverage sector‚Äìnamely, category expansion, increased category focus, and evolving consumer needs and expectations.\n Companies mentioned in this report  include : J&amp;J Snack Foods, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Mars, Incorporated, Mondelƒìz International, Nestl√©, Starbucks, Unilever\n Other relevant research:  \n  Five Trends in US Food CPG: Transparency, Sustainability and Technology Lead the Way  \n  Five Key Strategies for CPG Companies to Tackle Inflation and Changing Consumer Behavior in 2023  \nSee all reports in the Coresight Research  US CPG Sales Tracker  series\nVisit the Coresight Research Food, Grocery and CPG Retail Hub to explore sector data, reports and company profiles.\n This report is for Premium subscribers only.

These purchases give companies a deeper presence in certain categories without saddling their businesses with huge amounts of debt or the complexities of integrating a new business. \nExecutives attending the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Florida last month said smaller transactions are likely to remain popular, and they are poised to strike if the right deal comes along.\nDirk Van de Put, CEO of , told Wall Street analysts.\n \nThe past few years have seen food makers engage in a handful of billion-plus deals, but in nearly every case it has been with a single company or brand that fills a void within their already burgeoning portfolios.\nLast year, jam and peanut giant J.M. Smucker dolled out nearly $6 billion to buy Hostess Brands to deepen its presence in indulgence categories and consumer occasions focused on convenience. And Campbell Soup, which already owns Prego, announced plans in August to buy Sovos Brands, the owner of premium pasta sauce brand Rao‚Äôs, for $2.7 billion.

At the same time, higher interest rates could deter involvement from private equity firms. Together, these changes could place General Mills in a better position to capitalize.\nHarmening said.\n \n Retrieved from Sovos Brands. \nVan de Put said he is often asked if the current economic turmoil has helped bridge the divide between the price sellers are seeking, and what companies like Mondelƒìz are willing to pay.

The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. ‚ÄúOur consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they‚Äôre more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,‚Äù said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood ‚Äî the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body‚Äôs total serotonin. \n‚ÄúPeople now understand the gut‚Äôs connected to everything,‚Äù said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be ‚Äúprobiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.‚Äù \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company‚Äôs most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer‚Äôs] needs and what‚Äôs top of mind for them,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúFirst is gut health. That‚Äôs the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.‚Äù"},{"score":0.16296230256557465,"title":"Inside The Multibillion-Dollar Supplement Industry: Trends And Insights","id":"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/emerging-markets/23/12/36205088/inside-the-multibillion-dollar-supplement-industry-trends-and-insights","url":"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/emerging-markets/23/12/36205088/inside-the-multibillion-dollar-supplement-industry-trends-and-insights","publishedDate":"2023-12-12","author":"Dylan Wielemaker","text":"In 2022, the global supplements market was worth an estimated $164 billion. Over the next 7-10 years, it is expected to grow by 9% year-on-year. This is a huge amount, especially considering that many industries are seeing market retractions due to a looming recession.  But why is the dietary supplements industry rapidly growing while other industries are faltering? Are there any key trends that we should be on the lookout for over the next few years?  Let‚Äôs take a dive into the industry and answer these questions. The Growth of the Dietary Supplements Industry In the next seven years, the massive dietary supplement industry is expected to double. Very few industries will come close to this, especially in the face of recession. The reasons behind this substantial growth are multifaceted. Rising Health and Product Awareness More and more people are becoming aware of the importance of maintaining their health. They understand why getting a good blend of vitamins and nutrients is essential. Some people may even understand a little about the impact of certain nutrients on the body. As a result, they will head out and find products they know can help them. This phenomenon is observed frequently in the fitness industry. Head to any gym, and you‚Äôll find people touting the benefits of proteins for muscle building, caffeine for staying alert, creatine, carbs, and more. This heightened awareness is unprecedented. Why it has happened is anybody‚Äôs guess, but it is likely influenced by greater access to the internet. People talk about fitness on websites, social media, and more. This is fantastic. The more people are aware of how important it is to look after your health, the better! Of course, the fact that products are marketed more is also helping. It isn‚Äôt enough for people to know they need to be healthy; they need to know the products that can help make them healthier. Look around, and you‚Äôll see supplements mentioned in tons of places now ‚Äì on TV, in magazines, on social media, on YouTube, and more. Growth of Sports Nutrition The area that has seen the most growth in the supplements industry has been sports nutrition. The most significant surge in sales of sports supplements occurred during 2021/2022. Many speculate that the growth was driven by the average person‚Äôs desire to get healthy after spending time inside due to COVID-19 shutdowns worldwide. Sports nutrition was likely also driven heavily by the growth of product options on the market. Gone are the days when things were about protein powders and steroids (don‚Äôt touch steroids), but you can now find unique product formulations designed to target specific workouts. For example ‚Äì pre-workouts are rising in popularity for those who crave the extra dose of nutrients to keep them focused and driven on exercise. Increased Access to Products Perhaps the major driving force behind the growth of the dietary supplements industry is access to products. A few years ago, sourcing supplements would have been hard. While you likely would have found standard supplements at certain health stores (or even your local grocery store), e.g., vitamins, some minerals, and proteins, you wouldn‚Äôt have found anywhere near the range that is available today.  So, if you were a bodybuilder (for instance), you would either need to make do without the nutritional supplements that everybody else was using or spend an age trying to track down where they came from, no doubt going through countless shady sources (i.e., products that didn‚Äôt work) before you found a supplements company that worked. Nowadays, everything is out in the open. Companies like Huge Supplements sell a huge selection of products online. These products can be bought almost anywhere in the world, and you have a greater selection than ever. Obviously, when product access increases, the market will increase, too. Increased Age of Population As the population ages, the demand for health supplements increases. This is because many people will take their health much more seriously or help keep certain health conditions at bay. This is likely going to be a major factor in the supplements industry going forward, particularly with vitamins and minerals and products specially formulated to combat age-related conditions e.g., reducing wrinkles, combatting diabetes, etc. Shift in Diets There are some people who are looking into supplements to help fill a void in changing diets. It is fair to say that in this fast-paced world, people aren‚Äôt quite putting together the delectable dishes that people would have done in the decades past. This means some people are sorely lacking in certain nutrients, and supplements are helping with this. Trends in the Dietary Supplements Industry As the dietary supplements industry gains traction, discernible trends are beginning to emerge. Part of this is through the desire of new companies to stand out from the crowd, while other trends are through the desire of customers to have their supplements provided differently. The anticipation is that the following trends could persist over the years. Better Product Formulation Nutritional science is better than ever, and a lot of cash is spent on product development. Compare the supplement formulations from today to those of just a few years ago; it is night and day. There is a notable improvement in comprehending the impact of certain ingredients on the body, and companies are looking into ways to apply the scientifically proven beneficial nutrients into their supplements. The places where supplements are produced are better equipped, too. Take Huge Supplements, for instance. They are a big business that has invested much time and effort into product formulation. Only the highest quality ingredients are used, and their products can deliver results that others cannot. More Direct Sales While standard retail sales still constitute the majority of sales for specific products such as vitamins and certain powders, a shift is evident towards more direct sales. This means that people are buying directly from the manufacturer of the product. This means a few things: \nCheaper prices\nBetter quality products\nA more direct relationship with those producing the product.\nA larger range of products.\n Again, companies like Huge Supplements are driving the industry here. Never before have so many supplements been available from a single company.  More Personalized Supplements This is a new part of the supplement industry, but it is expected to be a major focus for a few companies in the coming years. More personalized supplements will allow people to tailor their supplement stacks to their needs.  It is already possible to some extent when you shop at businesses that sell a large array of supplements, but in the future, there will likely be more choices in what goes into the supplements. This means that no supplement will be the same. It will always be tailored to the user. The Future of the Dietary Supplements Industry The dietary supplements industry is only going to continue to grow. As it does, expect more product innovation, options, and greater investment in the business. Nowadays, the supplements on the market are better and healthier for us than ever before. In the future? That could improve even further thanks to improved science, product formulation, and access to products. This growing industry holds promise for exciting developments.

MBA student in Finance and Sustainability. \n  getty  \nWhile organic growth has long been considered the traditional path to expansion, growing a business through acquisitions has become increasingly popular. There are advantages to this approach and challenges, so it's vital for business leaders to determine whether or not this route makes sense for their organizations.\nThe era of Baby Boomers facing succession challenges has opened new doors for business acquisitions. Studies indicate that Baby Boomers control 50% of the country's $140 trillion wealth, with private businesses making up $7.4 trillion of this amount. This represents a significant opportunity for interested buyers, highlighting the potential for growth and investment in this landscape.\nBased on my experience, here are some advantages and disadvantages of business acquisitions as well as criteria to help you evaluate whether this strategy might be beneficial for your business.\nThe Pros Of Acquisitions\n Expansion \nAcquiring an established company grants you access to its existing customer base, operational infrastructure and market presence. Instead of starting from scratch, businesses can leverage the acquired company's resources and capabilities, allowing them to enter new markets, expand geographically or diversify product offerings swiftly.\nIn comparison, organic growth can require significant time and effort to   establish a foothold. This method could entail challenges related to market penetration, customer acquisition and brand recognition.\n Mitigating Market Uncertainty \nThe business landscape is full of uncertainties, including changing consumer preferences, evolving technologies and economic fluctuations. Growing a business organically requires navigating these uncertainties, making accurate predictions and allocating resources accordingly. In contrast, acquisitions offer a degree of stability and predictability.\nAcquiring an established company means a business can leverage their historical performance, market position and customer data, providing a clearer picture of potential risks and rewards. This means business leaders can make strategic decisions based on concrete data and insights, mitigating the inherent uncertainties associated with organic growth.\n Competitive Edge And Market Positioning \nIn a competitive business landscape, acquisitions can provide a distinct advantage in terms of market positioning. By acquiring a direct competitor or a company with a complementary product or service offering, businesses can strengthen their market presence and consolidate their position. Acquisitions allow businesses to quickly gain a competitive edge, propelling them to the forefront of the industry.\n The Cons Of Acquisitions \nAs enticing as the prospect of rapid expansion or immediate access to new markets may seem, business acquisitions are not without their potential pitfalls. Let's delve into some of the challenges, limitations and steep learning curves that are often associated with this strategy.\n Integration Challenges \nOne of the biggest hurdles in a business acquisition is the blending of two distinct company cultures. Each company has its own ways of doing things, its own ethos and its own values. Merging these different elements into a consistent whole can be difficult and sometimes lead to employee dissatisfaction, decreased morale or even attrition.\n Financial Burden \nAcquisitions are costly. Even after the purchase price has been paid, there are often costs related to integrating the businesses. Unexpected expenses can arise, and the anticipated financial benefits might take longer to materialize than initially projected.\n Overestimation Of Synergies \nIt's common for businesses to overestimate the synergies an acquisition will create. It's important to remember that theoretical synergies don't always translate into real-world benefits. McKinsey &amp; Co found that 10% of all large M&amp;As fail every year.\nChoosing the right growth strategy is a pivotal decision for any business owner. Acquisitions, while potentially lucrative, require substantial investment and carry inherent risks.\nIs An Acquisition Right For Your Business?\nHere are several factors a business owner can consider to determine whether an acquisition is the right strategic approach for their business.\n Alignment With Business Goals \nBefore proceeding with an acquisition, the business owner should clearly define their long-term goals. An acquisition should align with these goals, whether it's expanding into new markets, acquiring new technologies or scaling operations.\n Financial Readiness \nAn acquisition is a significant financial investment. It's important to conduct a thorough financial analysis to assess if the business can afford the acquisition without endangering its financial health. This should include not just the cost of the acquisition itself but also the costs of integration and any potential hidden liabilities.\n Management Capacity \nA larger organization will require different management skills. The business owner should evaluate whether the existing management team can handle the increased complexity and whether they have the necessary skills to manage the transition and integration process. Drawing from my experience, I've observed that business owners tend to have an overly optimistic view of their team's readiness for these challenges.\nBy taking the time to consider these factors, business owners can make an informed decision about whether an acquisition aligns with their strategic objectives and operational capacity. While acquisitions can provide opportunities for rapid growth and expansion, they are not without risks and challenges. \n Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.

These assets have transformed businesses like never before, and in this ecosystem, services, products and consulting players have come to the forefront as vital influencers in the industry.\nTo that end, all tech players have been actively buying assets adjacent to their existing base capabilities. The race is to provide holistic, best-in-class offerings at the lowest possible cost and highest benefit to clients across sectors.\nWhile this article is going to address such challenges in the context of the technology sector, primarily services and consulting, minor changes should be expected within other industries.\nHow can organizations capture value from these assets?\nWhen looked at from the buyer's perspective, organizations will typically leverage the acquired company to unlock value through one of two means: either horizontal integration or vertical integration. Horizontal integration is geared towards gaining market leadership and competitor displacement, while vertical integration is for cost-efficient blended offerings.\nAn example of horizontal integration is a capital markets consulting powerhouse that chooses to acquire a blockchain consulting leader or a customer relationship management technology SaaS leader that decides to purchase a marketing automation leader. Meanwhile, an example of vertical integration is a cloud IaaS provider acquiring an infrastructure management software company.\nRegardless of which category the acquisition falls into, certain aspects of value delivery strategy are common.\n 1. Technology product integration and joint capability development should be accounted for, as both companies combine service or product capabilities and develop a value proposition of combined offerings. The goal is to eliminate multiple vendor interaction inefficiency challenges for the client and position one's organization as a one-stop solution for all client needs. Joint value propositions are critical for downstream co-selling motions and improve the market positioning of both buyer and seller organizations.\n 2. Through-the-line marketing is crucial after creating a combined value proposition to propel the organization forward. This calls for a good mix of above-the-line broad-based, and below-the-line account-specific targeted marketing campaigns. Brand identities of the acquired organizations get refreshed with a strapline of the buyer and must remain visible across all digital and physical assets till a decision is made for sunset and transition to the parent organization.\n 3. Product development (for IP or platform acquisition) and pricing strategy are key to structuring cross-linkages, process flow and the end-state user journey of the combined product portfolio play a critical role in client receptivity during selling motions.\nIn short, the blended end-state product and a well-benchmarked and competitive pricing strategy would be crucial to ensure that the initial market share built-up happens quickly.\nWhile the market selling motions across the above factors are typical, certain aspects will bifurcate when it comes to an end-state org and operational integration.\n 1. People strategy is critical for both horizontal and vertical acquisition integration strategy. During the initial interim phase, the market-facing teams must carry shared goals and drive cross-sell of products and services. Horizontal integration acquisition must reach a single end-state organization across all business and corporate functions per an agreed-upon timeline. While the vertical integration acquisition might require both market-facing teams to remain independent due to the sheer fact that selling strategy and buying centers and cycles are different. Given no close commonality between both market rhythms, both teams cannot be truly integrated into one in the short to medium term. However, as they learn mutual capabilities over the long term, both market-facing teams get folded into a single structure.\n 2. Back office operations should provide the systems and process architecture to drive day-to-day routines, business agility and decision making. For horizontal acquisitions, all functional business processes should move and align with the buyer's, which should provide benefits of scale, while for vertical integration acquisitions, a case-by-case basis decision must be made.\nHere are some anticipated challenges in the journey to end state operating model.\nWhile the guidelines and strategies are in place for bringing businesses together and realizing value, that doesn't mean leaders should expect smooth sailing from there on out. Right decisions and reasonable flexibility for the acquired company will preserve goodwill from the intangibles related to culture, management practices and leadership motivation. Below are some key callouts.\n 1. DO focus on market and edge locations as the priority. Divert efforts and resources toward market activities. Growth is panache!\n 2. DO abide by the rules of engagement for market selling motions. Brand identity, shared goals, additional synergy incentives, deal qualification and priority clients should be laid out clearly for both teams.\n 3. DO operational integration of acquired organization business processes with caution. Assess any client work-related enabling functions for any disruption to agility before folding them onto the acquired organization.\n 4. DO set the ground rules for decision making on matters. Benchmark corporate governance practices, lay out decision-making charters and align standards.\n 5. DO NOT overlook the organizational risk profile. The risk could emerge from any dimension, loosely defined contracts, data privacy breaches or cyber security attacks.\n 6. DO NOT change any unique workplace practices or policies abruptly or immediately. Having the flexibility to retain any unique cultural aspects makes a huge difference in employee engagement.\nCapability-centric acquisitions are unique from those connected to scale or new category creation.\nFor vertical integrations, a hybrid end-state operating model requires a well-thought-through execution plan that both allows for scope and is well-paced, well-communicated and well-governed. At the same time, horizontal integration is a complete assimilation of both teams' time.\nIn either case, the value capture strategy needs to be designed on sound fundamentals, tied to the deal rationale‚Äîand the execution needs to be tight. This foundation will help propel the combined organization to a clear market leadership position exponentially more than either could have achieved going solo. \n Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.

This trend is largely driven by several key factors that enable companies to enhance their market presence, adapt to consumer demands, and ensure financial stability. Here are some of the primary motivations behind M&A activities in this sector:\n\n## 1. Expanding Presence in Specific Categories\n\nBusinesses in the nutrition industry are leveraging M&A to deepen their presence in trendy categories such as snacking, frozen foods, and \"better for you\" products. These categories have witnessed significant growth and consumer interest. By engaging in smaller, bolt-on transactions, companies can avoid the high risk and complexity of integrating new businesses associated with larger deals. For instance, the acquisition of specialty brands allows firms to tap into niche markets without overextending financially.\n\n## 2. Filling Portfolio Gaps\n\nAnother strategic driver for M&A is the need to fill gaps in existing product portfolios. Acquiring brands that complement or enhance a company‚Äôs current offerings can lead to a more comprehensive and competitive market presence. Notable examples include J.M. Smucker's acquisition of Hostess Brands to delve into the indulgence category and Campbell Soup's purchase of Sovos Brands to add premium pasta sauces to its lineup. These acquisitions enable companies to offer a more diversified range of products, catering to a broader consumer base.\n\n## 3. Strategic and Financial Alignment\n\nExecutives are increasingly cautious and strategic about their M&A decisions, ensuring they align with both strategic goals and financial prudence. Companies like Conagra Brands, while focusing on debt reduction, remain open to acquisitions that reinforce their core categories such as snacks and frozen foods. This careful approach ensures that new acquisitions fit seamlessly within the existing business model, promoting sustainable growth.\n\n## 4. Price Considerations\n\nThe economic environment and market conditions significantly influence M&A activities. Fluctuating valuations, driven by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and changing interest rates, impact the price expectations of potential deals. Some companies have noted that high asking prices can deter acquisitions, despite a strong interest in expanding through M&A. As markets stabilize, more favorable conditions may emerge, making acquisitions more attractive.\n\n## 5. Adaptation to Market Conditions\n\nCompanies are continually adapting their M&A strategies to stay relevant and competitive. This involves not only responding to emerging market trends but also anticipating future consumer preferences. For example, there is a growing interest in products emphasizing health, sustainability, and transparency. Businesses that can align their M&A activities with these evolving demands are more likely to achieve long-term success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, the pursuit of M&A in the nutrition industry is a multifaceted strategy driven by the need for growth, portfolio diversification, financial prudence, and alignment with consumer trends. Companies that effectively leverage M&A can strengthen their market positioning, better meet consumer needs, and navigate the complex economic landscape."},{"name":"What buyers look for in a vitamin, supplement, or nutrition target business","intr":"4-6 things with a short summary","summaries":[{"url":"https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/wellness/supplement-category-update-1235923485/","text":"The article discusses key considerations for buyers in the vitamin, supplement, and nutrition target business within the nutrition industry.

Younger consumers, particularly Gen Z and millennials, show a stronger preference for sustainability compared to baby boomers.\n\nPopular sustainability claims include ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly,‚Äù ‚Äúresponsibly sourced,‚Äù and ‚Äúzero waste,‚Äù although certain terms like carbon claims can be polarizing. While sustainability interest is high, barriers such as limited product choices and higher costs persist. However, 65% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable products, and it's expected that the price gap will narrow as more sustainable products enter the market and regulatory mandates increase transparency."},{"url":"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/08/08/consumers-abandon-plant-based-meat-category-citing-taste-nutrition-price-concerns-mintel-reports","text":"The article discusses buyer preferences and market trends in the nutrition industry, specifically related to plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs).

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic supplements because they trust that these products have undergone rigorous testing and adhere to organic standards. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages.

Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling. Dietary supplement sales, particularly those of tablets, are dynamic and subject to change in response to customer preferences and new health issues.

The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. ‚ÄúOur consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they‚Äôre more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,‚Äù said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood ‚Äî the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body‚Äôs total serotonin. \n‚ÄúPeople now understand the gut‚Äôs connected to everything,‚Äù said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be ‚Äúprobiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.‚Äù \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company‚Äôs most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer‚Äôs] needs and what‚Äôs top of mind for them,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúFirst is gut health. That‚Äôs the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions. For instance, in August 2022, one of the key dietary supplement brands, You theory launched a line of new liquid dietary supplements post its acquisition by Jamieson Wellness Inc. The new product comprises of ingredients such as B12B6, K2D3, and ashwagandha offered in liquid and capsule forms.

Vitamins and minerals are among the dietary supplements frequently used to treat and prevent age-related health problems. \nPoor eating habits and fast-paced, stressful surroundings are standard features of modern lifestyles.

Consumers are willing to pay a premium for organic supplements because they trust that these products have undergone rigorous testing and adhere to organic standards. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are actively seeking products that promote overall well-being. They are actively seeking transparency in product ingredients and sourcing, further fueling the demand for organic alternatives. Many governments around the world are promoting organic agriculture and incentivizing the production and consumption of organic products. This support has contributed to increased availability and variety of organic dietary supplements in the market. Thus, the rising emphasis on organics products fuels the growth of the market.\nFor instance, in November 2022, Jollywell announced the launch of a new range of plant-based and clean products in its dietary supplement line. The newly launched supplements are scientifically formed with good and natural ingredients to make it safer for consumption without any risk of side effects.\n Restraint \n Regulatory hurdles \nDietary supplements must stick to specific labeling and regulatory requirements to provide accurate and transparent information to consumers. Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market. An ageing population, growing interest in preventative healthcare, and increased awareness of health and well-being have all contributed to the steady rise of the global market for dietary supplements. The market size as a whole is frequently significantly influenced by the vitamin category. Vitamins C, D, E, and many B vitamins are commonly found in dietary supplements. Consumers select supplements depending on their unique health demands, as different vitamins are linked to different health advantages. An emphasis on natural and organic ingredients, clean labelling, and individualized nutrition has all impacted consumer preferences for dietary supplements.\nThe belief that specific vitamins could enhance immune system performance, promote healthy bones, or offer antioxidant advantages has sparked consumer curiosity in Vitamin supplements. Countries have different laws governing dietary supplements, and market participants must adhere to strict quality and safety requirements. For instance, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act regulates the U.S. market and lays out precise guidelines for product claims, safety, and labelling. To satisfy customer requests, companies in the dietary supplement industry always develop novel vitamin combinations, delivery systems, and formulations. The utilization of innovative substances, such as plant-based sources and bioavailable versions of vitamins, may be one of the emerging terms.\nForms Insights\nAmong different form insights, the tablet segment holds the largest share of the dietary supplement market. They frequently have a neutral flavor, are portable, and are simple to consume. Manufacturing dietary supplement tablets with different combinations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, and other bioactive substances is possible. Tablets can be made up of one or more components. They can treat various medical conditions, including immune system support, joint health, and vitamin and mineral shortages. Certain tablets, known as extended-release or sustained-released tablets, are made to release their components gradually, giving a more prolonged lasting impact and lowering the frequency of doses required.\nA broad spectrum of consumers can benefit from tablets, including those who struggle to swallow capsules or prefer a more recognizable supplement form. The market for nutritional supplements, including tablets, is governed by national regulatory frameworks. Regulations frequently govern ingredient safety, health claims, and labelling. Dietary supplement sales, particularly those of tablets, are dynamic and subject to change in response to customer preferences and new health issues. As of my latest report, a growing number of people were interested in individualized nutrition, natural and plant-based supplements, and general health and well-being.\nApplication Insights\nThe energy and weight management segment is observed to lead the market in the upcoming years.

The primary factors driving the market growth are the growing population of senior citizens, rising awareness and focus towards preventive healthcare, and rising demand for the sports nutrition supplements. Additionally, consumers are moving towards self-directed care, which is also expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements in the U.S.\n \nConsumers in the U.S. are shifting towards self-directed care, which has helped in shaping the growth of the dietary supplements industry in the country. Consumers are opting for nutraceuticals than prescription pharmaceuticals owing to growing focus on preventive healthcare. The high cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and the reluctance of insurance companies to cover the cost of drugs have further helped the dietary supplements industry solidify its presence in the U.S. market. Increasing hospitalization costs are driving consumers toward nutraceutical and health supplements, further aiding the market growth.\nThe dietary supplements market in the U.S. is challenged due to the changing regulatory pressure. The market requires greater intervention from government pertaining to product manufacturing, distribution, safety, and testing. Over the past decade, the U.S. market has witnessed an increase in labeling violations concerning dietary supplements. This has led to increased stringency related to safety standards of the dietary supplements. The registration of the products will be challenging henceforth. However, tightening of the regulations will favor the product safety and quality in consumer‚Äôs best interest leading to growing consumer trust towards the sector.\nThe rapid socioeconomic development over the decades has resulted in increased cases of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes across various segments of the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), in 2020, about 697,000 people in the U.S. died from heart disease, which is 1 in every 5 deaths. These rising health concerns have driven consumers to eat better and lead healthier lives.\nHowever, with busy schedules and little time to make healthy, nutritious meals, consumers are relying on dietary supplements to make up for the inadequate intake of the required nutrients. Furthermore, the high per-capita cost of healthcare in the U.S. is projected to prompt consumers to ensure the intake of additional supplements.\n Ingredient Insights \nBased on ingredient, the market is segmented into vitamins, botanicals, minerals, proteins &amp; amino acids, fibers &amp; specialty carbohydrates, omega fatty acids, probiotics, and others. In 2022, vitamins held a dominant position in the market; accounting for a share of 30.11%. This is primarily attributed to changing preferences and progressive aging of the U.S. population.\nAmericans are becoming increasingly health conscious and are interested in maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Vitamins are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements, especially those who may not get all the nutrients they need from their diet alone. Vitamins can be formulated with specific nutrients and doses to address various health concerns, such as immunity, bone health, and brain function. Vitamins A, B, C, and D-are expected to gain popularity among working professionals and sportspersons during the forecast period.\nProbiotics and omega fatty acids are also expected to record a significant growth rate of 6.7% and 6.6% respectively during the forecast period. The demand for probiotic supplements stems from increasing gut-related issues and food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements are further beneficial for immunity and preventive healthcare which is likely to drive its growth during the forecast period.\n Form Insights \nBased on form, the market is segmented into tablets, capsules, soft gels, powders, gummies, liquid, and others. The capsules segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 30.30% in 2022 and is expected to retain its dominance during the forecast period.\nThe demand for capsules is attributed to its convenience and design. Capsules provide protection to the active ingredients from light, moisture, and oxygen. This further helps to preserve the potency and quality of the supplement during time leading to increased shelf-life. The rising importance of microencapsulation in the health &amp; wellness industry to ensure the controlled release of finished products, along with maintaining the color characteristics, is expected to encourage manufacturers to opt for capsule dosage forms throughout the forecast period.\n \nGummies are expected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Over the recent past, manufacturers have focused on launching gummy supplements owing to its increasing preference among consumers. Gummies are likely to emerge as a profitable category during the forecast period. These were initially formulated for adults unwilling to take pills and later became popular among other groups as well because of their visual appeal and easy digestion. According to a survey by The Harris Poll found that 28.0% of adults in the U.S. have tried gummy vitamins in the past year, and 53.0% of those who tried them reported taking them daily. These trends indicate the increasing consumer preference towards gummy supplements in the U.S.\n Application Insights \nIn 2022, the general health segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 23.66% owing to the growing emphasis on general and overall health and wellness. According to a survey conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) in 2021, found that 80.0% of Americans were incorporating dietary supplements into their routines, indicating a 7.0% rise from the preceding year. The main driving force behind this trend is changing consumer dietary habits concerning preventive healthcare.\nCardiac health is projected to record the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. The rising occurrences of cardiovascular diseases owing to sedentary lifestyles, especially among those in the age group of 30 to 40 years, and fluctuating dietary patterns are expected to propel the intake of supplements featuring ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium to regulate heart health.\n End-user Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the adults dominated the market with a revenue share of 46.23% in 2022 owing to growing health awareness among working professionals and athletes about the importance of maintaining a balanced diet which creates a significant demand for the dietary supplements to maintain general health.\nThe U.S. consumers especially women are incorporating dietary supplements in their established health and wellness routines due to the increasing health consciousness. Furthermore, sports athletes are likely to influence the demand for protein-based supplements used for muscle growth, energy &amp; weight management, and recovery. Additionally, sedentary lifestyle is very common in the U.S. and it is largely associated with a range of health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. This is expected to drive demand for the dietary supplements among adults to mitigate the health-related risks.  \n Type Insights \nIn terms of revenue, the OTC (Over-the-Counter) segment dominated the market with a revenue share of 85.17% in 2022. The consumer trend of self-directed health care is likely to drive demand for the OTC supplements. OTC supplements are often less expensive than prescription supplements, which can make them an affordable option for the consumers. With the growth of e-commerce and online retailers, it has become easier for the consumers to purchase dietary supplements online, which has contributed to the segment growth.\nConsumers are opting for OTC supplements owing to the factors such as illness prevention and treatment. Consumers are shifting towards natural over-the-counter products due to their increased efficacy in treatments and health management. The OTC segment is anticipated to develop at a significant CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period.\n Distribution Channel Insights \nThe offline distribution channel is estimated to dominate the market with a revenue share of 78.13% in 2022. An increase in prescribed dietary supplements by the medical practitioners for treating gastrointestinal disorders, immunity-related issues, bone health, folic acid deficiencies, heart health, and age-related macular degeneration, among others, is a key factor driving demand for the dietary supplements through offline distribution channels.\nApart from this, geriatric consumers in the U.S. prefer purchasing dietary supplements through traditional distribution channels as they are not tech-savvy. This further boosts the segment growth.\nThe online distribution channel is expected to record the fastest growth rate of 6.3% during the forecast period. The advent of COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the growth of e-commerce in general, including the online sales of dietary supplements. According to a 2021 survey by Nutrition Business Journal online sales of dietary supplements in the U.S. increased by 20.8% to USD 14.3 billion in 2020, representing a significant growth trend.\nBulk discounts, convenience of online shopping, and 24/7 availability of wide range of products is likely to favor the growth of online distribution channels in the U.S. dietary supplements market.\n Key Companies &amp; Market Share Insights \nThe market is moderately fragmented but is expected to witness moderate to high competition among the companies owing to the presence of numerous players across the country. The changing consumer preferences owing to focus on well-being and preventive healthcare has led to key players focusing on new product launches and expansions in the U.S.\nKey players such as ADM, Abbott, and Herbalife Nutrition are characterized as market leaders owing to wide and diversified product portfolio, strong brand presence, strong financial strength, and large distribution network.\nSome of the key strategies adopted by the prominent market participants include new product launches, expansions, and acquisitions. For instance, in August 2022, one of the key dietary supplement brands, You theory launched a line of new liquid dietary supplements post its acquisition by Jamieson Wellness Inc. The new product comprises of ingredients such as B12B6, K2D3, and ashwagandha offered in liquid and capsule forms. This new launch is in line with the growing consumer demand for the nutritional supplements in the U.S. Some of the prominent players in the U.S. dietary supplements market include:\nAmway\nAbbott\nBayer AG\nGlanbia plc.\nPfizer Inc.\nArcher Daniels Midland\nGlaxoSmithKline plc.\nNU SKIN\nHerbalife Nutrition\nNature's Sunshine Products Inc.\nDuPont de Nemours Inc.\nNOW Foods\n Report Attribute \n Details \nRevenue forecast in 2030\nUSD 78.94 billion\nGrowth rate (Revenue)\nCAGR of 5.7% from 2023 to 2030\nBase year for estimation\n2022\nHistorical data\n2017 - 2021\nForecast period\n2023 - 2030\nQuantitative units\nRevenue in USD million/billion, CAGR from 2023 to 2030\nReport coverage\nRevenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, trends\nSegments covered\nIngredient, form, application, end-user, type, distribution channel\nRegional scope\nU.S.\nKey companies profiled\nAmway; Abbott; Bayer AG; Glanbia plc.; Pfizer Inc.; Archer Daniels Midland; GlaxoSmithKline plc.; NU SKIN; Herbalife Nutrition; Nature's Sunshine Products Inc.; DuPont de Nemours Inc.; NOW Foods\nCustomization scope\nFree report customization (equivalent up to 8 analyst‚Äôs working days) with purchase.

The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. ‚ÄúOur consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they‚Äôre more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,‚Äù said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood ‚Äî the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body‚Äôs total serotonin. \n‚ÄúPeople now understand the gut‚Äôs connected to everything,‚Äù said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be ‚Äúprobiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.‚Äù \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company‚Äôs most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer‚Äôs] needs and what‚Äôs top of mind for them,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúFirst is gut health. That‚Äôs the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.‚Äù"},{"score":0.1595415472984314,"title":"U.S. household expenditure on nonprescription vitamins 2022 | Statista","id":"https://www.statista.com/statistics/630728/us-household-expenditure-on-nonprescription-vitamins/","url":"https://www.statista.com/statistics/630728/us-household-expenditure-on-nonprescription-vitamins/","publishedDate":"2023-08-16","author":"Dominique Petruzzi; Sep","text":"Premium\n   Premium statistics    Industry-specific and extensively researched technical data (partially from exclusive partnerships).

Plenty of publications describe the cross-industry predictors of startup success, like quality of the founding team and operational rigor. But throughout my career as an academic, entrepreneur, and investor, I‚Äôve found a dearth of materials answering the field-specific question: ‚ÄúWhat makes a good therapeutics development program?‚Äù This article outlines my hypothesis-driven approach for evaluating the quality of any given therapeutics program as one component of the larger drivers of success for a company. Using this framework, a program is viable for development if all hypotheses outlined in Figure 1 are true. This methodology is not the only solution, but I hope its availability will help academics looking to translate promising discoveries, early-career entrepreneurs who want to ensure their assets will stand up to scrutiny, and new venture associates developing their diligence process. ‚Äç    Figure 1. Framework for the Evaluation of Therapeutics Development Program Quality  A program is viable if all hypotheses are true, but an integrated assessment is essential to differentiate ‚Äúviable‚Äù from ‚Äúpotentially transformative‚Äù programs. A spark that makes a program stand out could come from revolutionary biology rooted in deep insight into unmet need, herculean academic efforts to create a drug-like molecule in a chemically challenging but sought-after class, or even from outside this asset-focused framework in the form of a proven, energetic team. On the other side of the coin, it is rare to find a program without ‚Äúwarts‚Äù in the form of one or more uncertain hypotheses that should be de-risked as the program advances. In each case, experience-based judgment is critical to convert evaluation of a program‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses into a useful business decision. While it‚Äôs impossible to detail all considerations that might support or refute the hypotheses from Figure 1 in a single post, some examples of the types of data and analyses that can support each are provided as a primer below. Target Validation  Conviction that modulating the target will address an unmet need is table-stakes for a therapeutics program. A compelling data package will often center on experiments in an animal disease model. This may be genetic interventions for a target-to-hit program, or pharmacologic modulation with a lead compound at later stages. In either case, the ideal experiment will mirror the way a patient might use a therapeutic arising from the program. For example, if patients are typically not aware of their disease until it reaches an advanced stage, the most compelling experiments will treat animals with a fully established disease. In the strongest data package, the in vivo foundation is supported by a variety of orthogonal experiments pointing toward the same conclusion. In vitro experiments using patient-derived samples and real-world data such as GWAS may, for example, suggest the observations in mouse models would translate to the human condition.  ‚Äç Druggability The ability to modulate a target in a therapeutically useful way is among the greatest challenges in biopharma. One needs not only inhibit a cellular activity, but access the relevant tissues, for an appropriate length of time between dosing, and without affecting other critical biological processes. For Hit-stage and later programs, characterization of the most advanced asset (e.g., potency, ADME, PK, etc.) will identify the specific challenges that must be overcome to achieve a drug-like candidate. For pre-Hit programs, historical precedent for similar targets will indicate feasibility. For example, small molecule drugs have been FDA approved to inhibit many enzymes with an accessible catalytic pocket, but targeting transcription factors or scaffolding proteins may require newer, more challenging modalities that elevate cost and risk. ‚Äç Safety Safety remains a risk to any drug until years of post-market data is available, and the acceptable profile will vary based on severity of the disease targeted and the effect size of the drug. However, guideposts exist that may indicate the magnitude of that risk in the context of a given development plan. For early-stage programs, knockout mice and GWAS associations may differentiate a target with minimal overt on-target consequences suitable as a preventive agent from a target where liabilities will likely limit use to severely ill populations. For Lead and Candidate stage programs, careful design of chronic in vivo proof-of-concept experiments can enhance confidence in tolerability for the specific asset; if there is a known liability risk, for example, the relevant tissue may be harvested and examined for abnormalities alongside efficacy readouts. For later stage programs, standard GLP-Toxicology and clinical experience provide more robust confidence in acceptable tolerability for an asset. ‚Äç Translational Path One of the most frequent, expensive failure points in drug development is the Phase 2 trial, where only ~30-50% of drug candidates manage to show an efficacy signal in patients. Many factors contribute to Phase 2 failures, but among the most common explanations are: ‚Ä¢ Poorly predictive animal models: For monogenic diseases excellent mouse models are often available; targeted mutation in the causative gene may recapitulate the disease phenotype, and clinically proven treatments may even confirm their predictive validity. However, preclinical models are of questionable translational value for certain complex diseases. In these cases, heightened risk can sometimes be partially mitigated by innovative technologies such as patient derived organoids, but development cost and uncertainty will remain greater. ‚Ä¢ Sub-optimal dosing: Converting an efficacious animal dose to an equivalent human dose is not straightforward, and even sophisticated pharmacokinetic models incorporating differences in bioavailability, protein binding, and stability are imperfect. A target engagement biomarker, which allows direct confirmation that a drug is exerting its desired biological effect, is a critical tool to minimize expensive phenotypic dose-finding studies. While de novo technology development can sometimes address translational challenges, the landscape of pre-existing technology sets baseline risk and required investment arising from this category.  ‚Äç Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) At-scale manufacturing of a never-before-synthesized drug product is not trivial! The product must be pure, reproducible, stable during storage, and sufficiently inexpensive that the unit economics will be favorable once commercialized. Required CMC expertise and investment should not be underestimated for a small molecule, but biologics and newer modalities such as gene therapy are a special challenge. Traditional small molecules and antibodies will typically not require process optimization before candidate selection, but more nascent modalities such as cell therapy will benefit from in-house expertise early in the development process. Special attention may be paid to manufacturing costs in the context of modality and target indication. For example, an autologous cell therapy which costs tens of thousands of dollars per dose to manufacture would be inconsistent with a preventive indication where benchmark pricing is &lt;$20K annually, but could be acceptable in oncology where benchmarks range upwards of $100K. ‚Äç Clinical Path The challenge of demonstrating clinical efficacy will differ by disease across several axes, including: ‚Ä¢ Regulatory uncertainty, which is driven by the existence of precedent. For example, multiple drugs have been approved for rheumatoid arthritis and the FDA has published guidance documents that clearly outline expectations for future therapies. For other indications, no therapeutic has yet reached Phase 3 clinical trials, and acceptable endpoints will need to be defined in consultation with regulators. ‚Ä¢ Feasibility, which is largely determined by availability of patient populations to the drug developer; patients may be concentrated in a few centers or spread across many, or multiple clinical-stage companies may be competing to engage a limited pool of patients for their trials.  ‚Ä¢ Resource intensity, which is most influenced by the current standard of care, the magnitude of effect expected for the therapeutic, and the rate at which the study endpoint manifests. For example, standard of care for some diseases like diffuse large B cell lymphoma achieve cure rates of &gt;75%, meaning large trials are required for even a 90% effective therapeutic to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. Similarly, the impact of a drug on some diseases can be assessed in weeks via a test of functional capability; in others, participants must be followed for years to observe the clinical outcomes of treatment. ‚Äç Commercial Opportunity It is an unfortunate reality that low commercial potential impedes for-profit investment in many diseases with high unmet need. This phenomenon is best illustrated by the category of ‚Äúneglected tropical diseases‚Äù, which primarily affect impoverished populations and remain largely untreated due to inability to recoup investment from patients. One worst-case scenario for a drug developer is to incur substantial expense to advance through Phase 1 trials yet fail to reach patients because poor commercial opportunity compromises their Phase 2 and Phase 3 investment case. Key drivers of commercial opportunity include pricing, size of the indicated population, and the commercialization force necessary to drive sales. These factors, which are among the largest drivers of net profitability, should be weighed against development costs to ensure that economic returns are possible. A risk-adjusted net present value analysis can integrate the dozens of assumptions necessary for this comparison, and can directionally indicate the commercial opportunity of a program or highlight key risk areas. ‚Äç Intellectual Property For-profit pharmaceutical investors require substantial future cashflows to compensate for the high cost and risk of development. Even with good unit economics, generating sufficient cashflows is only possible by obtaining exclusivity ‚Äì a time period during which the developer holds a monopoly on sales of the drug. The most robust exclusivity mechanism is a composition of matter patent, which protects the structure of the drug and forms the core of most intellectual property portfolios. While a granted patent is not essential for most pre-Candidate programs, a clear path to obtaining one is. As the program advances a portfolio of additional patents will ideally provide supplementary protection, often covering formulations, dosing, and other methods of use. Regulatory exclusivity mechanisms such as the seven years attached to orphan drug approval can supplement a patent portfolio, but their length is rarely sufficient to protect an investment on their own.  A more detailed overview of intellectual property considerations created by true experts is available free-of-charge through one of the world-leading legal firms, Morrison Foerster. ‚Äç Enacting this approach can drain substantial organizational resources if analyses are not carefully managed. In my experience, a balance of efficiency and rigor can be achieved by progressing the effort through stages of increasing analytical depth targeting the most uncertain hypotheses first. For example, one might complete a ‚Äúpre-assessment‚Äù to highlight potential areas of weakness in the program. Then in a second stage, one might engage technical experts in the highlighted areas to answer tailored questions that can confirm or refute those weaknesses. Ultimately, the appropriate depth to stop analysis will be determined by its purpose; a clinical-stage acquisition requires a lot more certainty than a discovery-stage portfolio prioritization decision!

The goal is to find a business whose risk matches your appetite.\n\n4. **Improvement Potential**: Have a clear thesis on how you can improve the business compared to its current state.\n\n5. **Operational Challenges**: The main risk isn't the business failing instantly but rather losing interest or mismanaging it, leading to gradual decline.\n\n6. **Retention Adjustments**: Evaluate acquisition and retention numbers critically, considering the owner‚Äôs level of hustle and engagement.\n\n7. **Marketplaces vs. Brokerages**: Online marketplaces have a lot of noise; brokerages offer better quality leads.\n\n8. **Seller‚Äôs Motivation**: The reason for selling is a significant indicator of the business's potential and current health.\n\n9. **Financial Engineering**: Techniques like seller notes or consulting retainers can mitigate risks during transition periods.\n\n10. **Data Requests**: Collect extensive usage data and understand the business's current revenue drivers.\n\n11. **Pricing Strategy**: Investigate the potential for pricing changes and experimentation.\n\n12. **Financial Cleanliness**: Clean and organized financial records are crucial for smooth transactions.\n\n13. **Sourcing Difficulty**: Finding suitable businesses can be challenging due to market illiquidity.\n\n14. **Operational Knowledge**: Document as much existing operational knowledge from the seller as possible.\n\n15. **Deal Quality vs. Price**: The quality of a deal takes precedence over the price; a business with issues may still be valuable if acquired at the right price.\n\n16. **Post-Close Efforts**: Initial operations post-acquisition require more effort than anticipated.\n\n17. **Focus Areas**: It's easier to impact marketing, ops, and pricing than product development.\n\n18. **Platform Rewards**: Platforms can offset many operational deficiencies.\n\n19. **Cold Sourcing**: Less competition exists for businesses found through cold sourcing as opposed to brokerages.\n\n20. **Valuable Contractors**: Trustworthy contractors are extremely valuable and hard to find.\n\n21. **Due Diligence**: Dog-fooding (using the product yourself) is an effective diligence method.\n\n22. **Payment Providers**: Not all are equal; choose wisely.\n\n23. **Job Perspective**: Acquiring a business is akin to buying a job, so ensure it's something enjoyable or meaningful.\n\nColin and Harrison contributed to refining the essay, and for those interested in selling their software business, contact information is provided."},{"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/174rwpu/supplement_store/","text":"The provided text is not an article but a forum post from someone in the UK seeking advice on opening a supplement store.

The article highlights key considerations and steps a business owner should take to ensure a successful sale:\n\n1. **Enlist Expert Help**: It is crucial to have an experienced transaction team that includes accountants, lawyers, and a transaction adviser (investment bankers for larger deals and M&A brokers for smaller ones). These experts can guide you through the M&A process and help manage negotiations with potential buyers.\n\n2. **Understand the Buyer‚Äôs Perspective**: Maintaining momentum and creating competition among buyers is essential. Potential buyers may try to exploit a lack of interest by retrading terms before closing a deal. Experienced bankers and brokers can help manage and keep the process competitive.\n\n3. **Choose Experts Wisely**: Use specialists for the M&A process rather than relying on general accountants or lawyers. An expert team can navigate the specifics of business sale transactions and avoid costly mistakes.\n\n4. **Market and Business Insights**: Be realistic about the company's value by understanding industry standards, the company‚Äôs size, and its business model. Knowing how your business measures up within your industry helps in setting proper expectations.\n\n5. **Financial Clean-Up**: Ensure your financial records are clear, accurate, and meet generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Misrepresented financials can lead to a disappointing valuation or failed deal. Components like adjusted EBIT should be fully understood and accurately displayed.\n\n6. **Research Potential Buyers**: Conduct thorough due diligence on potential buyers. Verify their track record of closing deals and understand their company culture, especially if you or your team are expected to remain post-acquisition.\n\n7. **Prepare for the Grind**: The selling process involves detailed due diligence that can be mentally and physically exhausting. Sellers must balance keeping the business running smoothly while managing the transaction process.\n\nThe article concludes with a strong recommendation to not go through this process alone but to lean on experienced professionals to alleviate the workload and stress. A capable team can help the seller achieve a successful sale and maintain business performance throughout the selling period."}],"queries":["factors to consider before selling a vitamin supplement business","challenges in selling a nutrition products company","valuation and market trends for selling a supplement business"],"searchResults":[{"score":0.15592847764492035,"title":"8 Major Factors To Consider When Selling Your Business","id":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2023/11/27/8-major-factors-to-consider-when-selling-your-business/","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2023/11/27/8-major-factors-to-consider-when-selling-your-business/","publishedDate":"2023-11-27","author":"AllBusiness","text":"By YEC  \n  getty  \nFor many entrepreneurs, the prospect of a buyout offer can be tempting. However, amid the whirlwind of excitement and potential financial gain, it's important not to lose sight of critical factors that can significantly impact the deal. Here, Young Entrepreneur Council members share what they consider the most critical factors to consider before selling your business.\n While it's easy to get lost in the excitement, what's one key factor you must consider when another company offers to buy your business, and why? \n1. Potential bad actors\nCompetitors often express an interest in purchasing a business merely to gain as much information about that business as possible with no intent of actually completing the purchase. Be sure to have a solid mutual non-disclosure agreement in place before you share any of your confidential information, and trust your gut before you share too much of your company's secret sauce. ‚ÄîDoug Bend, Bend Law Group, PC \n2. Your company's price\nThe key factor to consider is what price you're willing to sell your company for. Being clear on your price target will help you quickly determine whether you should proceed with going through the expensive and time-consuming process of completing an M&amp;A transaction. ‚ÄîNanxi Liu, Blaze.tech \n3. Implications on your lifestyle\nIs your business a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù business, built to scale or built to sell? I started with a lifestyle business because I truly love the professional services we offer. After a decade, my focus was on scaling and offering our services to a wider audience. If somebody asked me about buying, I would ask myself what I would do with my time because my work and helping people define a large part of my life. ‚ÄîGivelle Lamano,  Oakland DUI Attorneys  \n4. Your involvement after the sale\nThink about how much you want to stay involved after the deal. It's important because your level of involvement can affect the future direction of the business. You need to decide if you want to continue leading the company, have a transitional role, or step away completely. It's all about finding the right balance between letting go and staying connected. ‚ÄîAbhijeet Kaldate, Astra WordPress Theme \n5. Your company‚Äôs value over time\nThe most important factor to consider when another company offers to buy your business is an assessment of where your company will be in the next five or 10 years. This will make it easier for you to decide whether or not you should sell your business. The offer given to you may be lucrative, but you'll know the actual worth of your business after you've carefully estimated its true value. ‚ÄîStephanie Wells, Formidable Forms \n More articles from   AllBusiness.com  : \n Why You Shouldn‚Äôt Be Scared to Build Your Own Website \n 8 In-Demand Senior Care Business Ideas \n6. Maintaining customer relationships\nOne factor that you must consider when another company offers to buy your business is how to continue maintaining customer relationships. You must have invested your time, effort, and money to build a strong customer base, and they might start feeling disconnected if a new company takes over your business. Make sure to talk it out before merging your company with another. ‚ÄîThomas Griffin, OptinMonster \n7. The deal‚Äôs fine print\nDon't forget to read the fine print during the due diligence process. Most deals come with spicy clauses that will impact you personally or your team‚Äîlike by keeping you aboard for years after the exit or slashing your existing team in half. Openly discuss future goals and commitments on both ends. Don't be surprised if the new direction collides with your vision. ‚ÄîMario Peshev, Rush \n8. The terms of the deal\nMake sure you're okay with the terms of this deal and that you are ready to meet the requirements of your buyer. Sometimes, agreeing to sell the business is the first step in a long process, which may include growing your business to a certain ROI and meeting very particular milestones before you can sell.

Gummy vitamins have become increasingly popular among health-conscious individuals. These tasty and chewy supplements offer a convenient, enjoyable way to take vitamins and minerals. With the growing demand for gummy vitamins, it can be a profitable venture to launch your own gummy vitamin brand. However, starting a vitamin business can be a daunting task, especially if you are new to the industry. This post will share some insider tips and tricks to help you launch a successful gummy vitamin brand. Conduct Market Research Before creating your gummy vitamin brand, it is critical to conduct market research to identify your target audience, competitors, and market trends. Understanding your audience‚Äôs needs and preferences and what other vitamin brands are already on the market can help you differentiate your product from the rest of the competition. Through market research, you can also identify gaps in the market and create unique selling points for your brand. Choose the Right Gummy Vitamin Manufacturer Choosing the right gummy vitamin manufacturer is crucial in starting a successful vitamin brand. A reliable and experienced manufacturer can provide high-quality products and ensure consistency in taste, texture, and ingredients. Look for a manufacturer that is FDA registered, GMP certified and has experience in manufacturing gummy vitamins. Ask for samples, visit their facilities, and ask for references from their past clients to ensure you are working with the right partner. Develop a Strong Branding Strategy Great branding can make your gummy vitamin brand stand out and be memorable to your target audience. Your brand should reflect your company‚Äôs values, mission, and unique selling proposition. Make sure your logo, packaging, website, and social media profiles are aesthetically pleasing and communicate your message clearly. You should also develop a branding message that resonates with your audience and showcases the benefits of your products. Focus on Quality and Transparency Quality and transparency are essential in the supplement industry. Ensure that your gummy vitamins meet the highest quality standards, are manufactured with high-quality raw materials, and are tested for purity, potency, and safety. You should also be transparent with your customers by providing clear information about your ingredients, dosage, and certifications. Provide a certificate of analysis (COA) or third-party test results to show the quality and purity of your products. Promote Your Gummy Vitamin Brand Once you have developed your gummy vitamin brand, it is time to promote it to your target audience. Utilize different marketing channels such as social media, influencer marketing, email marketing, and paid advertising to reach your audience. Make sure your message is consistent across all channels and resonates with your target audience. Don‚Äôt forget to leverage customer reviews and testimonials to establish credibility and trust with your potential customers. Launching a gummy vitamin brand can be profitable and exciting, but it requires careful planning and execution. By following the tips and tricks discussed in this blog post, you can increase your chances of success and differentiate your brand from the competition. Remember to conduct market research, choose the right gummy vitamin manufacturer, develop a strong branding strategy, focus on quality and transparency, and promote your gummy vitamin brand to your target audience."},{"score":0.13800501823425293,"title":"5 Important Factors To Consider Before You Sell Your Business","id":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2023/11/28/5-important-factors-to-consider-before-you-sell-your-business/","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2023/11/28/5-important-factors-to-consider-before-you-sell-your-business/","publishedDate":"2023-11-28","author":"Darryl Lyons","text":"Co-founder/CEO of   PAX Financial Group, LLC  . \n  getty  \nYou deserve it. You have spent decades making financial, personal and emotional sacrifices, and now is the day to reap the reward. As a fellow business owner and a family of small businesses, I know firsthand how the sigh of relief sounds when you sell. But, don‚Äôt rush to put the for sale sign up too quickly. First, you must consider maximizing your value, tax strategies and life after work. To help, I‚Äôve listed five critical factors to consider before selling your cherished small business.\nValuation\nBusiness owners often sell to a key team member or family with back-of-the-napkin math. This math is often rooted in what the owner thinks it‚Äôs worth or how much the owner needs. Both of those methods fall short. I suggest you consider completing a valuation comparing your business to similar businesses recently sold in the marketplace. Ideally, but not entirely necessary, you can pay for a certified valuation that adds a layer of detail by someone who is an expert in valuing businesses.\nEnsure Your Books Are In Order\nI‚Äôm sure you expense your gas, weekly lunches and maybe even some dry cleaning on your profit and loss statements. As you move closer to the exit, you must take the personal items off the books. This exercise will also wake you up and help you realize how much your business supports your lifestyle. Cleaning up your books makes it easier for buyers to value the business and, simultaneously, enables you to understand how much money you need in life without the business.\nPractice Pivoting\nYour identity has been in the business, and your exit will be more emotional than a freshman moving to a new high school. It‚Äôs important for business owners to think deeply about what time they get up in the morning and what they do after that first cup of coffee. You don‚Äôt want life to be only news and gardening, so it‚Äôs important to think of your life outside of the business.\nIdentify A Successor\nAccording to a UBS survey, 89% of business owners who plan to sell and consider keeping the business within their family cite a lack of interest from their heirs. Selling to a stranger is likely not what you had in mind when your toddler sat in your desk chair. Because the next generation is not expected to grab the baton, it is imperative to gauge interest from multiple potential buyers. Business brokers, industry groups and peers can all play a role in finding the right partner. And, just like real estate, the price tends to go up with multiple bidders competing.\nConsider Gifting Equity\nIf you are charitable, you may want to consider gifting a portion of your business to a donor-advised fund (DAF) before signing any selling agreements. This gift will allow you to receive an immediate tax deduction and avoid paying capital gains on a portion of the business. Of course, please speak to your tax advisor to discuss your unique situation to ensure it works for you.\nBeing a business owner is undoubtedly one of our country‚Äôs most magnificent opportunities. But hard work isn‚Äôt enough; I want you to finish strong. Think deeply about what life looks like post-transaction and consider all alternatives before inking the deal. If you take your time and have wise counsel, you can sell with no regrets.\n The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

See our ethics policy. \nRecently I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about failure. At the end of 2022, I shut down Proteau, the nonalcoholic drinks company I started. I had dedicated the past five years of my life to it, and for just three of those years saw my bottles in the market. I can‚Äôt escape the feeling that I‚Äôve failed, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said that seeing other, similar brands in the marketplace did not elicit a jittery tinge of envy, as if others‚Äô success was paid for with my defeat. But I‚Äôve also come to realize that it‚Äôs easy for us to see our efforts in a binary success-or-failure model ‚Äî and that framing is completely inadequate for our lives and the projects we pursue. \nMy career in the beverage industry had an extremely auspicious start. In 2008 I began bartending at Please Don‚Äôt Tell. From there I went on to bartend at Momofuku Ssam Bar for a few years before pitching myself as the company‚Äôs first bar director. Along the way, I honed my skills in concocting elaborate nonalcoholic drinks that replicated the look and taste of many traditional cocktails.\nIn 2017 I was at an inflection point in my career. I‚Äôd opened 10 restaurants for Momofuku and I was about to write my first book when I learned about an accelerator program helping to launch nonalcoholic drink businesses. There are a lot of people who don‚Äôt drink alcohol, and I wanted to make something for those people ‚Äî to include them in the fancy drinks conversation. It also seemed to me the natural evolution of a career as a bartender: to go from creating drinks for people in a bar setting to creating a cocktail that could be on a shelf anywhere. \nI applied for the program, and I got in. This was the beginning of Proteau and the development of two botanical nonalcoholic aperitifs that I named Rivington Spritz and Ludlow Red. I worked with the team at the fund on the branding and the drinks themselves, and we eventually secured startup capital from the fund‚Äôs parent company, a huge spirits conglomerate. This was a few years before the nonalcoholic drinks industry exploded, and we were hoping to be one of the first to market. \nStarting Proteau was the hardest I‚Äôve ever worked on anything in my life. And it was exhilarating. I spent hundreds of hours refining recipes in my kitchen. I arranged dozens of slide decks and took day trips from my home in Manhattan to visit labs in California and bottle factories in Mexico City.\nWith the guidance of the team assigned to me by the accelerator fund, I spent the startup capital as quickly as I could, developing the liquid from a kitchen-made prototype to a commercial product that could be produced at massive scale. I designed a custom bottle and spent hundreds of thousands on art, branding, and communications. I won‚Äôt go so far as to say I was encouraged to spend as much money as possible as quickly as possible, but the people around me, people I thought were there to guide me towards long-term success, never really gave me any indication that I should be pinching pennies. Almost immediately after securing my initial funding, I began to plan a second funding request, which we ultimately got. It was like I had a money hose at my disposal.\nMy plan was to launch in New York City and Los Angeles (at one point, my team was discussing renting an entire house in Los Angeles for a month to support the launch there, just to give you a sense of scale). I also wanted Proteau to be available online as soon as possible and I spent tens of thousands of dollars on custom gift boxes, complete with metallic foil-stamped gift tubes for the bottles. And it wasn‚Äôt like I was sitting in my apartment packing these boxes up myself and hand-delivering them to UPS ‚Äî I found what‚Äôs known in industry parlance as a ‚Äú3PL‚Äù (third-party logistics), a facility that handles all the logistics of assembling online orders and getting them out to customers. All for a price, of course.\nIn October of 2019, I rented out the rooftop of a Lower East Side boutique hotel for the New York launch. That week I got my first restaurant account, Gramercy Tavern. I picked up a few more wholesale accounts. Meanwhile, online sales were modest, supported by a handful of high-profile media mentions. In January of 2020, I flew to Los Angeles to host a launch luncheon for a dozen key journalists and beverage professionals. My PR team got me a tasting at Goop HQ in Santa Monica and I crisscrossed the town pouring Proteau at bars and restaurants, a few of which went on to place my product on their menus. In January, I also began gearing up for another funding request, but the team at the accelerator fund called it off and postponed it until March. I thought nothing of the change at the time; they had told me that my investor was keenly following my progress and was excited to continue to support me. \nI never thought about seeking additional funding elsewhere. The terms of my investment deal were unusually restrictive: I was essentially barred from obtaining money from any other source and my lawyers said I was a ‚Äúglorified employee‚Äù of the company that was funding me. I was fine with this. All I wanted was to launch this product out into the world; it was delicious, and people needed it. I didn‚Äôt care about hockey stick growth or revenue multipliers or any other arcane startup jargon. My interest was in creating a mechanism for producing delicious drinks and getting them into as many glasses as possible.\nBut my investor‚Äôs interest in supporting me for the long haul was weaker than I thought ‚Äî a lot weaker. I went in front of the investment board the morning of March 12, 2020. The mood was a bit shaky ‚Äî the first COVID-19 wave was looming. I had spent the entire week rehearsing my pitch and it went flawlessly. But later that day, I got the call from one of my advisors that the board decided to discontinue support of the company. Not only were they rejecting my request, they were also saying that they were done with the brand forever and that I would be released to secure additional funding on my own. It turns out that over the few months prior, unbeknownst to me, my investor had become skeptical of Proteau‚Äôs format, which was more like wine ‚Äî ready to drink straight from the bottle ‚Äî and it didn‚Äôt fit into the company‚Äôs portfolio of mostly spirits.\nI don‚Äôt know how many of you reading this have had the hopes and dreams you built up over years casually cast aside by a panel of strangers, but it fucking sucks. The whiplash was completely destabilizing. I went from being told that I would eventually sell my company for millions of dollars to not knowing if the company would last through the summer. I‚Äôm grateful for the fact that I had decided to take a year-long break from consuming alcohol in 2020 because I‚Äôm sure I would have self-medicated the pain and confusion.\nI immediately scrambled to find new investors. I know that some people thrive off the process of pitching their business to potential investors with promises of explosive growth, but I found it humiliating. The stain of having been rejected by my initial investor was too much. I kept a massive spreadsheet of every investor I ever contacted. The ones I did get meetings with all had a similar refrain: ‚ÄúEverything looks great, but come back to me when you have more revenue.‚Äù And usually the revenue target was $1 million or more. To me this was absurd. Why would I want to sell off chunks of my company when I was pulling in a million dollars in sales per year? My conclusion is that most investors aren‚Äôt really looking to take big risks ‚Äî they want to take small money machines and turn them into big money machines.\nIt wasn‚Äôt just me that was affected: In late 2019 I had hired a COO and a brand ambassador. My COO stayed on, unpaid but on the company‚Äôs health insurance plan for another year, while we had to let the brand ambassador go in the middle of the summer of 2020. \nI never secured additional funding. I tried a crowdfunding campaign but the platform I chose was so slow and difficult to work with I canceled the campaign despite sinking time and money into regulatory prep work. Even though COVID decimated the restaurant industry, I had revenue from online sales (plus a forgiven PPP loan and multiple dimensions of spousal support) to keep the company going for a lot longer than I expected. I set up an export pipeline to retailers in Canada, racked up dozens of favorable press mentions, and even made an appearance in Neil Patrick Harris‚Äôs Instagram story about his favorite nonalcoholic drinks. \nBut that ended on December 31, 2022, when I ceased all operations for an unspectacular reason: I ran out of inventory.\nIt‚Äôs easy to characterize this as a failure. In a crucial way, it was. The company no longer exists and the product that I spent years developing is gone. And yet, I consider myself extraordinarily lucky that I was given this opportunity at all. I was given the power and resources and tools to bring an idea into reality ‚Äî to create. I was allowed to problem-solve and make mistakes daily, whether it was with the label on the bottle or the shelf life of the liquid in it, and to fix them. And what is problem-solving but managing success and failure at the exact same time? I know I‚Äôm not a fuckup ‚Äî I‚Äôm self-employed and making (just barely) six figures, I‚Äôve written two successful cocktail books, and the nonprofit I founded, Restaurant Workers‚Äô Community Foundation, has raised $11 million and counting. And I know that I‚Äôm also lucky in that I was born into a white, cisgender male body, grew up in one of the wealthiest zip codes in the country, and have the support of my husband whenever I needed it.\nWe are often told that small business is the core engine of our economy, but the privilege of entrepreneurship is offered to so few. Not only do we not provide nationalized health care like almost every other wealthy nation, we tie what little coverage we do get to employment, making the leap to entrepreneurship mortally risky. In this context, I can‚Äôt see the ending of my company as tragic ‚Äî the real tragedy is that the chance to fail is afforded to far too few of us.\nNow, I look at the demise of Proteau in the larger context of my overall career and for the enormous educational and career-advancing opportunity that it was. It established my credibility as an expert in the nonalcoholic drinks field, which is a big part of my ongoing consulting practice. And if anyone wants to write me a check for $2 million to start the whole thing back up again, you know how to find me. \n   John deBary     is a semi-retired bartender turned drinks and hospitality expert who spends most of his time writing about drinks, including two cocktail books,    Drink What You Want    and    Saved by the Bellini   .

This is the first time Nutrabolt will hold a minority investment of this kind, CEO Doss Cunningham told Modern Retail. Under the deal, which was finalized this week, Nutrabolt will become Bloom Nutrition‚Äôs largest investor. Nutrabolt‚Äôs other brands include Cellucor and Xtend Energy, the latter of which it acquired in 2017. \nNutrabolt‚Äôs investment is part of a larger $90 million financing plan for Bloom Nutrition that also includes Amberstone, a consumer investment firm, and Clayton Christopher, the founder of Sweet Leaf Tea. Gregory LaVecchia and Mari Llewellyn, who co-founded Bloom Nutrition in 2019, will remain majority shareholders in the company, according to information shared with Modern Retail.\nNutrabolt launched its first product line, Cellucor, in 2002. In 2011, Nutrabolt introduced C4 workout powder, and in 2018, it debuted C4 carbonated beverages. While C4 does not disclose revenue, the company has grown year-over-year, it told Modern Retail in a previous interview. \nNutrabolt‚Äôs investment in Bloom Nutrition comes not long after it received its own cash infusion. In December 2022, Keurig Dr Pepper bought a 30% stake in Nutrabolt for $863 million. Now, Nutrabolt is taking on the role of investor as it looks to become a leading health and wellness company, Cunningham said. \n‚ÄúI think the future for our company is to do both organic brand-building and participate in what we think is highly accretive M&amp;A,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOver the next several years, we‚Äôre going to be focused on building our legacy brands, partnering with brands like Bloom to try and help them accelerate what they‚Äôre doing. And, there may be some full acquisition opportunities in the future, as well.‚Äù\nBloom Nutrition sells supplement powders packed with protein, greens and superfoods. It originated as a direct-to-consumer brand but now sells products via its website, Target, Amazon and Walmart. Llewellyn has said she was inspired to create Bloom Nutrition as a way to help women reach their fitness goals after embarking on her own weight loss journey. \nNutrabolt began investment talks with Bloom Nutrition in early 2023, Cunningham said. He believes Bloom Nutrition adds ‚Äúanother dimension‚Äù to Nutrabolt‚Äôs existing portfolio of performance products due to its emphasis on overall wellness and gut health. In addition, energy drinks have a male-dominated audience, Cunningham acknowledged, and by investing in Bloom Nutrition, Nutrabolt hopes to reach more women. Nutrabolt‚Äôs investment will provide Bloom Nutrition with capital for product innovation and ‚Äúexpanding internal capabilities,‚Äù according to the company.\nIn a statement, Bloom Nutrition‚Äôs LaVecchia said he was ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù to work with Nutrabolt. ‚ÄúTheir expertise and resources as industry leaders will enable us to scale effectively, fuel sales growth and accelerate innovation,‚Äù he said.\nThe better-for-you boom\nSo-called better-for-you energy drinks, nutritional supplements and vitamin powders have gained more attention and market share over the past few years, largely thanks to the pandemic‚Äôs emphasis on healthy habits. \n<"},{"score":0.14151383936405182,"title":"Vitamins and Supplements recent news | New Hope","id":"https://www.newhope.com/natural-product-trends/vitamins-and-supplements","url":"https://www.newhope.com/natural-product-trends/vitamins-and-supplements","publishedDate":"2023-12-27","author":"","text":"New Hope Network is part of the Informa Markets Division of Informa PLC   Informa PLC ABOUT US INVESTOR RELATIONS TALENT    This site is operated by a business or businesses owned by Informa PLC and all copyright resides with them.

The firm reports supplements are a $21 billion market, almost double the size of functional beverages at $12.3 billion.\nResearch shows that the trend is being driven by consumers who are proactively seeking solutions for self care, particularly as people become more educated about the ingredients and options. ‚ÄúOur consumer study showed that about 60 percent of Americans say they‚Äôre more engaged now with proactively managing their health than during the pre-pandemic years,‚Äù said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe.\nWhile immunity supplements have lost steam since the pandemic, supplements that promote digestive health, weight management, sleep and hydration are driving the growth of the category.\nGut health, in particular, has become an area of focus for many people. Digestive diseases are pervasive, with the National Institutes of Health reporting between 60 million and 70 million Americans are impacted by one. Furthermore, thanks to social media and clinical evidence, consumers are more aware of the impact gut health can have on other issues like stress and overall mood ‚Äî the NIH says the gut is responsible for 95 percent of the body‚Äôs total serotonin. \n‚ÄúPeople now understand the gut‚Äôs connected to everything,‚Äù said Ara Katz, cofounder and co-CEO of microbial health brand Seed, a leader in probiotic supplements. \nBecause of this growing understanding, Katz believes next-generation products will be ‚Äúprobiotics for specific organ systems and conditions.‚Äù \nCourtesy\nOther brands are also targeting the probiotic space. Ritual‚Äôs founder and chief executive officer Katerina Schneider reports that Synbiotic+, $54, was the company‚Äôs most successful launch to date and now represents more than 20 percent of its revenue. \n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always trying to understand the evolution of their [the consumer‚Äôs] needs and what‚Äôs top of mind for them,‚Äù Schneider said. ‚ÄúFirst is gut health. That‚Äôs the biggest open-ended category. In the United States people are suffering from a number of digestive issues, whether they‚Äôre stress-related or diet-related, or even hereditary.‚Äù \nAs microbiome health gains traction, glucose-focused supplements, notably those featuring berberine, are also growing due to the weight loss management properties. ‚ÄúThis is being driven by the introduction of Ozempic,‚Äù said Walter Faulstroh, cofounder and chief executive officer of Hum Nutrition.\nBerberine, coined nature‚Äôs Ozempic for its blood sugar management abilities, has become one of the hottest ingredients in the supplement market, as customers are looking for a natural and cheaper alternative to semaglutides. Brands like Hum Nutrition, Veracity, Revivele and Tally Health have responded with their own iterations featuring the ingredient. \n Hum Nutrition Best of Berberine  \n‚ÄúWe see this trend continuing in the next year, especially given the huge investment and new introductions of additional drugs,‚Äù Faulstroh said, noting the product, which launched in October, has already become a bestseller. Social media has also fueled the ingredient‚Äôs popularity, as its hashtag on TikTok has more than 100 million views. \nSleep has always been a mainstay of the supplements category, and it continues to grow. Insights from McKinsey show that 45 percent of people call better sleep ‚Äúa very high priority‚Äù and it is the ‚Äúgreatest unmet consumer need.‚Äù \nPart of this unmet need could be attributed to the growing confusion in the category. Recently, researchers from Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Mississippi found most melatonin products had up to 2.5 times the amount that was labeled. With this in mind, Ritual and Moon Juice both recently launched sleep supplements that lead with science and simplification. \n‚ÄúTwo thirds of our customers said that they were having a hard time falling asleep and then also staying asleep,‚Äù said Schneider. \n Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin  \nIn the wake of inappropriate sleep aid use, Ritual‚Äôs Sleep BioSeries Melatonin, $25, slowly releases specific levels of melatonin over time. Similarly, Moon Juice‚Äôs founder Amanda Chantal Bacon employed a microdose of phytomelatonin (plant-derived melatonin) in Sleepy Magnesi-Om, $38, an iteration of its bestselling magnesium powder. \nNew approaches like these will be key for differentiation in the category, experts say. \n‚ÄúUnique ingredient formulations are going to be a big driver,‚Äù said Mark Lacy, an investment banking director at Raymond James. ‚ÄúUnique twists [and] proprietary blends are going to be the future rather than just simple letter vitamins.‚Äù\nWith sleep a top priority, magnesium itself has gained a cult-like following. The ingredient, which can also manage stress, has 1.2 billion views on its TikTok hashtag and sales for magnesium-based products grew by 25 percent at The Vitamin Shoppe during the first four months of 2023.\n‚Äú[Magnesium] is in the zeitgeist now. It‚Äôs all over TikTok,‚Äù said Chantal Bacon, noting the brand‚Äôs Magnesi-Om, $42, has a high subscription rate. ‚ÄúMagnesium is the perfect on-ramp to wellness.‚Äù \n Sleepy Magnesi-Om  \nExperts say to expect similar mood-boosting ingredients to gain traction, like mushrooms, adaptogens and nootropics. According to Lacy, stress, mood and cognitive function will become key categories going forward. \nHydration, which is also essential for brain health, is expected to continue growing with brands like Liquid I.V. normalizing the conversation around electrolytes, and Trace Minerals educating on the need to add in minerals typically lost in water filtration systems. Data from The Vitamin Shoppe shows searches for hydration and electrolyte products grew 200 percent over a one-year period on the website. \n‚ÄúDehydration is such a fundamental challenge‚Ä¶75 percent of Americans are suffering from [it],‚Äù said Solheim. \nThe category has recently expanded. Moon Juice released Mini Dew, $44, a mineral- and electrolyte-based powder for hydration and brain health. Liquid I.V. launched a sugar-free format of its signature Hydration Multiplier, $26, to reach a wider audience. \nNiels Boon\nNew formats like powders are quickly replacing pills as the preferred method for ingestibles. ‚ÄúPills are really easy, but we still don‚Äôt take them,‚Äù said Katie Wilson, founder of probiotic bar brand BelliWelli.\n‚ÄúThere are many who suffer from pill fatigue‚Ä¶They want things that they look forward to taking,‚Äù Solheim agreed.\nGummies continue to boom, and many companies are experimenting with newer formats. For example, Sourse and Alice have both opted for chocolate-based bites. BelliWelli provides a dose of probiotics in dessert-flavored snack bars. Beekeeper‚Äôs Naturals and 8Greens pack their nutrients into lollipops. Thorne, which developed Caliray‚Äôs supplement that launched earlier this year, sells discs that dissolve into water.\nLiquids are also gaining traction, said Lacy, pointing specifically to Mary Ruth‚Äôs, a brand known for its bestselling multivitamins that are available at Target, Whole Foods and The Vitamin Shoppe. Cymbiotika, Elix, Apoth√©kary and Sakara Life have also tapped into this format through tinctures and liposomal delivery systems. \nWhile pills still comprise the largest sector of the category, newer formats are driving consumer education. Nielsen IQ reports that 77 percent of shoppers ‚Äúexpect product labels to be more specific and transparent,‚Äù as they look to decode the rapidly proliferating category. \n‚ÄúThe category going from 4,000 to 90,000 supplements without any major updates to regulation has made consumers their own advocates for safety and efficacy,‚Äù said Schneider. \nAt Ritual, that means transparency around all aspects of the production cycle, so consumers can explore ingredient sourcing, carbon emissions and clinical data on the website. For Hum Nutrition, education looks like content that clearly depicts how the product works, such as a video of how its bestselling bloat relief product Flatter Me, $26, breaks down certain foods.\nWhile offering education and clinical evidence is key, experts say to avoid overwhelming the consumer when first introducing a new product. ‚ÄúBecause of the clutter, put in a benefit first, and then back up with the ingredient,‚Äù said Solheim, pointing to Olly as an example. ‚ÄúThat allows the user to hone in quickly and then do their research.‚Äù \nAlthough certain formats, ingredients and companies are driving growth in the category, experts say there‚Äôs room for more. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for innovation. It‚Äôs definitely not saturated,‚Äù said Solheim, citing women‚Äôs health as a key area for growth. ‚ÄúThe addressable market is very large for products that deliver and can address these big needs. I see a lot of unmet need.‚Äù"},{"score":0.15113157033920288,"title":"Dietary Supplements Market Size to Hit US$ 346.36 Bn by 2032","id":"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dietary-supplements-market","url":"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/dietary-supplements-market","publishedDate":"2024-01-01","author":"","text":"Report Description \n Table of Content \n Request Customization \n The global dietary supplements market size was estimated at USD 176.19 billion in 2023 and is expected to hit USD 346.36 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 7.8% during the estimated period 2023 to 2032.

Claims made about the supplements‚Äô health benefits must be supported by scientific evidence, which can limit how companies market their products. Regulatory agencies may require dietary supplement manufacturers to follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to ensure product quality and safety. Meeting these standards can be challenging for smaller companies or those operating in developing regions. Companies are often required to report any adverse events associated with their products. This reporting process can be burdensome and may lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities. Different countries have varying regulations for dietary supplements, making it challenging for companies to navigate global markets. Compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks can add complexity to exporting and importing dietary supplements. Thus, such regulatory hurdles are observed to create a restraint for the market.\n Opportunity \n Booming e-commerce market \nE-commerce platforms allow dietary supplement companies to reach consumers worldwide. This expanded reach opens up markets that were previously difficult to access through traditional retail channels. Companies can target customers in various regions and countries without the need for establishing physical stores or distribution networks in each location. Online stores operate 24/7, providing customers with the flexibility to shop at any time. This accessibility removes the limitations of physical store hours and enables consumers to make purchases at their convenience, even in different time zones. Thus, the booming e-commerce market across the globe is observed to open opportunities for the market. \n Challenge \n Misinformation and false claims \nHealth professionals may become wary of recommending dietary supplements to their patients due to the prevalence of false claims. This reluctance can prevent people who could benefit from certain supplements from receiving appropriate guidance. Companies that make false claims about their products may face legal consequences from regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in fines and reputational damage. False claims can lead consumers to believe that certain dietary supplements are effective and safe when they may not be. This can lead to individuals taking supplements that could potentially be harmful or interact negatively with other medications they are taking. Thus, the misinformation about the product and false claims creates a challenge for the market‚Äôs growth.\nIngredient Insights\nVitamins hold the largest share in the dietary supplements market.

Rising concerns over environmental sustainability and concerns regarding animal welfare have majorly contributed to the growth of plant-based protein products. Additionally, plant-based protein powders contain fiber, which helps in smoother digestion and promotes good gut bacteria. Therefore, it is considered as a better substitute for animal based protein. The protein products derived from plant-based ingredients, including soy, pea, and rice are popular in the U.S. market, and their demand is increasing continuously. Therefore, the players are emphasizing on developing novel products to meet the increasing demand for plant-based supplements. For instance, in July 2022, Dymatize, a sports supplement brand owned by Post Holdings, Inc., launched plant-based protein powders. The new protein powder is vegan and plant-based, delivering high-quality protein pre-or post-workout. The protein powder is available in creamy chocolate and smooth vanilla flavors. The new protein blend offers a unique and versatile taste, mixing easily in water, smoothies, and other recipes. \nDRIVING FACTORS\n  Surging Demand for Sports Nutrition Supplements  to Aid Market Augmentation  \nProtein is a significant macronutrient popular for its help in muscle buildup and improves stamina and recovery. Thus, athletes, bodybuilders, and fitness enthusiasts opt for protein products for better results and wellness. According to the Council of Responsible Nutrition (CRN) on Consumer Survey, 2019, around 77% of Americans consume dietary supplements, out of which U.S. residents consume 28% of sports nutrition supplements. Various sports nutritional supplements include protein-based beverages, powders, drinks, bars, and shakes targeted to stimulate muscle growth, help with appetite control, and sustain overall good health. As consumers focus on fitness and body-building, sports nutrition supplements, including protein supplements are increasing across the U.S. market. In addition, several players develop protein-based sports nutrition products in bars, powders, and shakes form with consumer-oriented flavors. For instance, in June 2022, Kellogg, an American multinational food manufacturing company, expanded its Special K portfolio by launching new flavored protein snack bars in the U.S. The new products are available in berry vanilla and brownie sundae flavors and contain 6 gm of protein and 90 calories per bar.\n  Increasing Trend of On-the-Go/Ready-to-Drink (RTD) Products  to Contribute to Market Proliferation  \nThe evolving consumer preferences coupled with the rising demand for convenience foods is driving the demand for ready-to-drink products. Lack of time, hectic schedules, urban lifestyles, and growing requirements for nutritional products led to an increased demand for healthy meal options. Therefore, several protein-enriched products, such as bars and RTD/ready to drink beverages, have emerged as meal replacement options for people. Several players are tapping such opportunities and developing products that are convenient and provide adequate nutrition. For instance, in April 2022, Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., a brand offering low-carbohydrate bars, shakes, and snacks, launched two new snack bars and an RTD protein shake. The company launched an iced chai latte RTD protein shake with 15 gm of protein, 3 gm of net carbs, and 1 gm of sugar. The new product provides an on-the-go meal option fortified with proteins. \nRESTRAINING FACTORS \n  Excessive Usage of Artificial Sweeteners in Product will Hinder Market Expansion  \nSugar has become an inseparable part of various food products. The high usage of artificial sweeteners in the preparation of protein products such as shakes, powders, and bars has caused significant health concerns among consumers. Majorly, sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup are widely used sugars. Excess dietary sugar consumption may lead to health risks such as obesity and diabetes. Sugar intake is a major public health problem, and supplements with such artificial sugars are usually avoided by health-conscious consumers leading to hindrances in the U.S. protein supplements market growth. \nSEGMENTATION \nBy Product\n  Rising Number of Fitness Enthusiasts and Health-Conscious Consumers Urging the Demand for Protein Powders  \nBased on product, the market is segmented into protein powder, Ready-to-Drink (RTD), protein bars, and others.\nThe protein powder segment is expected to hold a significant share of the U.S. market. The increased number of fitness-enthusiastic youths and elite athletes across the U.S. propelled the rise in the number of health clubs and gyms.

The new product is a 100% plant protein powder specially designed for athletes and active individuals. The product is flavored with rich chocolate fudge and creamy vanilla flavors. \nBy Source\n  Higher Adoption of Animal-based Supplements Contributed in its Dominance  \nOn the basis of source, the market is categorized into animal-based and plant-based. Animal-based segment is expected to hold a significant market share of the market. The most common animal-based protein supplements are made up of whey or casein (milk-based), collagen, or egg. Animal-based protein powder tends to blend easier than plant protein, and thus has wide applications in sports and nutrition segments. The product is increasingly used in the supplements market due to its strong amino profile, which helps users build muscles and increase metabolism more than plant-based supplements. The rising fitness concern among adult consumers positively impacts segment growth in the coming years.\nThe plant-based segment is expected to grow at a high CAGR in the forecast period. The rising concerns over food safety, food allergies, and adopting veganism to end animal cruelty are the major drivers to propel the demand for plant-based protein supplements. Furthermore, the growing prevalence of lactose allergies and intolerance has also boosted the demand for plant-based protein products. \nBy Distribution Channel Analysis \n To know how our report can help streamline your business,  Speak to Analyst    \n  Availability of Branded Products to Propel the Sales from Specialized Retail Stores  \nBased on distribution channel, the market is categorized into specialty retailers, online stores, and others. The specialty retailers segment is expected to hold a significant market share of the market. Walgreens Co, providing a wide range of pharmacy and healthcare services in the U.S., is an ideal example of a specialized pharmacy retail store. Walgreens provides an omnichannel experience and offers private-label brands. It also helps consumers choose the right product according to their health and diet requirements, which helps build a strong relationship among the retailers and consumers and propel the segment's growth. \nCOUNTRY INSIGHTS\nConsumers in the U.S. tend to purchase supplements such as powders, drinks, bars, and others as they help in weight management. Obesity has been a significant issue for people in the U.S. According to a report, State of Obesity 2022, four in ten American adults have obesity issues, and the obesity rates continue to rise within the population. People with obesity are expected to have health problems such as high blood pressure and cholesterol; thus, people lean more toward healthy foods. Moreover, protein products are the most popular among athletes, diet-conscious adults, and the young generation. The increasing demand for convenient, on-the-go, and protein-enriched snack foods also is fueling the market in the country. For instance, in December 2022, Mars, Incorporated, an American multinational manufacturer of confectionery and other food products, joined the performance nutrition category with the launch of ‚ÄòHi Protein Bars‚Äô under its brand Snickers. The new product is a performance nutrition bar containing 20 grams of protein. The product is ideal for consumption after a workout or as a delicious snack. \nKEY INDUSTRY PLAYERS\n  Growing Consumer Awareness for High-Protein Products Encourage Companies to Expand Product Portfolio  \nThe interest in plant-based products and ingredients is gaining momentum and dominating the food &amp; beverage trends. The rise in flexitarian population is mainly due to consumers' willingness to stop or reduce meat consumption. Furthermore, consumers look for protein supplements from non-animal sources. Thus, the food manufacturers boost their product portfolios by developing products such as snacks, on-the-go foods, and drinks with plant-derived protein sources. For instance, in December 2020, Ingredion Incorporated, an American multinational ingredient provider, launched a pea protein isolate. The new product was launched to meet the increasing consumer demand for high-protein products. The new product contains 80% protein and helps manufacturers to make ‚Äòhigh-in-protein‚Äô front-pack claimed products.
