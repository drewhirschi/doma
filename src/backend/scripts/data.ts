Expands Operations Outside U.S. (North Canton, Ohio) March 22, 2018 – Area Wide Protective, a leading provider of traffic control services and equipment, has acquired Safety First – SFC, LTD., a complementary traffic control company based in Canada. “We are excited about our first acquisition outside the Continental U.S., said John Sypek, President and CEO of AWP. “Marrying AWP with Safety First increases our ability to service our current customers while providing opportunity for further expansion in the Northeastern U.S. and in Canada. We are impressed with the service offerings of Safety First and believe customers of both companies will benefit from this decision. It truly creates greater opportunity all around,” said Sypek. With the integration of Safety First, AWP now has eight additional offices across Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.

AWP’s acquisition of Safety First is preceded by its acquisitions of Tennessee-based FlagPros, Kentucky-based Kentuckiana Traffic &amp; Patrol, and Connecticut-based All State Traffic Control. All three acquisitions took place within the last eighteen months. “We believe that as our operations expand, so does increased work zone and road safety,” said Sypek. “Ed Hennessey and James McDonald have done a great job building a safe, strong team and company. We couldn’t be happier to welcome them into our AWP organization to help us advance our mission to make roads safer.” said Sypek. AWP, Inc.
